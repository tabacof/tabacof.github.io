    "text": "Motivation\n\nFirst data scientist role\nIn my first data scientist role, I was tasked with shipping a credit card fraud model. Long story short, I built a good enough model using PySpark that would have significant impact on the bottom line ($). To deploy it, a machine learning engineer (MLE) had to work full-time for months to build a model serving framework using Scala. To bridge the gap between Python and Scala, the models had to be serialized using MLeap. Why not use a Python server, something I had experience with? The company simply wouldn’t allow non-JVM servers in prod! There had to be a better way.\n\n\nFailed side hustle\nLater, I learned about AWS Lambda and realized I could have deployed the fraud model using it. It would run Python code, but not need a Python server or any associated infrastructure. This led me to the idea of creating a side hustle called Deploir:\n\n\n\nLanding page of Deploir\n\n\nThe idea was simple: a data scientist trains a model, generates a pickle, uploads the pickle to the website using a GUI, and 1 minute later they have an endpoint ready to be used at scale. Technically, the idea was sound and the prototype worked. Commercially, I couldn’t get one single conversion. Deploir taught me many valuable lessons about overbuilding (see this tweet for a hilarious and maximalist view). But it also taught me how to deploy real-time models using serverless tech, which I intend to share now."

    "section": "Real-time vs batch models",
    "text": "Real-time vs batch models\n\nReal-time models\nReal-time models serve predictions (almost) instantly. Usually, they serve one prediction at a time as they come. The prototypical real-time ML service in Python is a Flask server running a /predict endpoint that handles POST requests. After receiving a request with features in the payload, the server will process the features (if needed), call the model prediction function (e.g. model.predict(X)) and return the prediction as a JSON HTTP response. Then, the main application will do something with it, like approve or deny a loan. If something fails, the application returns a HTTP error. Check out a minimal example.\n\n\n\nTypical real-time ML application using Flask\n\n\nThere are many other possibilities to serve real-time predictions. You can use a different programming language other than Python by serializing the model in a language-agnostic framework like ONNX. You can use FastAPI instead of Flask, which is becoming more common over time as FastAPI is blazing fast with great Pydantic integration. Or you might use a queue (e.g. Kafka) and handle requisitions asynchronously. The details change, but the principles are similar.\nReal-time models have a couple of strong downsides:\n\nNeed to build, manage and maintain an endpoint or web server\nNeed to guarantee the feature engineering pipelines are the same for training and serving (which is more difficult than it seems!)\n\nBut it’s inevitable for some applications where the most informative features are only received in real-time:\n\nCredit card transaction fraud\nReal-time bidding for ad auctions\nChatbots\n\nBe sure to test your need for a real-time model empirically: train a model with just day old features and see how its performance compares to a model with real-time features. You might be surprised by how far “stale” features go.\n\n\nBatch models\nBatch models serve predictions in batch (duh) and generally at a regular frequency, typically every 24h. Those models are usually part of the data pipeline or ETL process. The prototypical batch ML architecture in Python is a Spark pipeline controlled by Airflow (or Snowflake controlled by DBT) that reads from production databases, makes all kind of data transformations, and somewhere along the way calls the model to make predictions, which are then pushed back to a production database to be used by the main application:\n\n\n\nTypical batch ML application using Airflow/Spark\n\n\nUse batch models if you can: you train models in batch after all! With batch models, it’s much easier to ensure the feature pipelines for training and serving are the same. You don’t have to maintain a web server or endpoint, only one or a few steps in the data pipeline. You can leverage everything the data engineers build in your favour.\nWhat are some typical batch model applications?\n\nPredicting churn in a B2B SaaS company\nCalculating credit scores\nEstimating Lifetime Value (LTV) of users\n\n\n\nHybrid models\nSince real-time models are sometimes inevitable (but be sure to test this assumption!) and batch models are easier to maintain, you can get the best of both worlds by chaining them together. For example, for a loan application, you can have a credit risk model that runs in batch based on past user behavior and external information like credit scores and another model running in real-time that uses the batch model as a feature plus other variables which are only available online (such as the loan amount). This offloads most of the complexity to the batch model, with the downside of having two models instead of one and having one depend on the other (so watch out for overfitting and leakage if the models re-use the same training examples)."

    "text": "AWS Lambda\nAWS Lambda allows you to run functions on the cloud without having to manage webservers. You send a Python function to AWS and, one minute later, can invoke it from anywhere. Lambda has strong but not unlimited scalability, so you generally don’t have to worry about up or downscaling servers to handle variable load.\nMost importantly, you only pay for what you use. The cost is proportional to the time spent in each function call. The price varies by other things such as memory used and network traffic, but you can use the following rule-of-thumb as a ballpark estimate for a typical workload: ~1M requests → $1.\nYou can create Lambda functions manually in the web interface or programatically using boto3. I strongly recommend the latter: you get reproducibility and more explicit control. There are two ways to create a Lambda function:\n\nZipping your script and artefacts (including library dependencies) into a file\nCreating a Docker image with your script and artefacts\n\n\n\n\nLambda deployment choices: go with Docker\n\n\nI highly recommend going with option (2): Python libraries for ML are quite large and will create an unreasonably large zip file, which may exceed the standard Lambda limits. With a Docker image, you can install libraries with a requirements.txt file and the limits are much looser (the image can be up to 10g). Also, a Docker image is reproducible with a Dockerfile and allows for local testing with the exact same behaviour as production.\nWhen I first built Deploir, only zipping was available. One of my technical breakthroughs was compressing the numerical and ML libs to make them fit the file size and memory constraints. I hope nobody else has to experience the same pain again!"

    "text": "API Gateway\nAPI Gateway allows you to wrap an endpoint around a Lambda function. There is no code involved, only configuration. You just specify you want to create a REST API with a POST endpoint using a certain Lambda function and the integration is done by AWS. You get one million requests for free every month and for subsequent use you pay $3.5 per million requests.\nUse API Gateway to distribute and control usage of Lambdas inside and outside your org. You can define API keys to use the endpoint with associated usage plans where you can set rate limits, throttling and quotas. The integration between API gateway and Lambda is seamless: it will pass along the request payload to the Lambda function event argument and it will return the request response from the Lambda return dictionary:\n\n\n\nAPI gateway: the lifetime of a request\n\n\nNote that there are two situations where you wouldn’t need to use API gateway:\n\nIf you only call the Lambda inside your org, so you can invoke it directly with boto3 or another AWS library\nIf you use Lambda function URLs to distribute your Lambda, which I wouldn’t recommend since API Gateway is already simple enough to use, quite cheap, and offers you more control"

    "text": "Trade-offs\nGoing serverless has many trade-offs. Check out When (and why) not to go serverless for a more general take. For ML deployment, we can be more precise about the trade-offs we face:\n\nWhy serverless model deployment?\nYou should go serverless if you cannot bear the costs of maintaining a Python server, whether they are the server cloud costs if you’re a poor entrepreneur, the human-engineering costs if you need to build a fancy Scala server (when Python is not allowed), or the time costs of managing a server yourself. Here are some examples that all have applied to me personally to go with Lambda in the past:\n\nYou are a data scientist (DS) and need to deploy a model but Python servers are not allowed\nYou are an indie hacker and want to sell something with high scalability but no baseline costs\nYou are a MLE and want to create a system where DSs send a model and get an endpoint back in seconds\n\n\n\nWhy not?\nYou should choose boring technology by default. If you can use Flask for your real-time model, do it! There will be a lot more resources, examples, and people with tacit knowledge and experience out there.\nIf your application has tight latency requirements, say you work with real-time ad auctions, the latency spikes from Lambda cold start might cause issues. You can prevent this by keeping the function warm manually, but this is hackish without any guarantees from AWS. You can provision concurrency, but you will pay for it, so the solution becomes less cost-effective.\nIf you operate at absurd scales like Prime Video, Lambda might not be cost-effective anymore since there are slight inefficiencies in the serverless model that are only apparent at scale. However, if the load varies a lot and unpredictably, Lambda can still outperform traditional web servers.\nIf you are at the limits of technology, say running LLMs inference on GPUs, it’s not even possible to start using Lambda in the first place."

The split\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\nand after a specific date.\n\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\nextractor.\n\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\n\n    =================   ==========\n    Classes                     20\n    Samples total            18846\n    Dimensionality               1\n    Features                  text\n    =================   ==========\n\n\nTo make the model outputs more interpretable and illustrative, I will only work with the classes as strings (e.g. \"rec.sport.hockey\") instead of numerical labels (e.g. 3).\n\nX_train = train_dataset.data\ny_train = np.array([train_dataset.target_names[i] for i in train_dataset.target])\n\n\nX_test = test_dataset.data\ny_test = np.array([test_dataset.target_names[i] for i in test_dataset.target])\n\n\nprint(f\"Train size: {len(X_train)}, test size: {len(X_test)}\")\n\nTrain size: 11314, test size: 7532\n\n\nNow, let’s build our model. Modelling is not so important for the purpose of this post, but TF-IDF + Logistic Regression is always a good idea for text classification. This is a bag-of-words approach: we will treat the words independently and the model will have to makes its predictions based on the presence or not of certain keywords. Logistic regression works well for sparse features, which is the outcome of a bag-of-words featurization. Alternatively, another strong baseline would be Naive Bayes.\n\ntfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_df=0.5, min_df=2, stop_words='english', use_idf=True)\nlr = LogisticRegression(C=1e2, solver='lbfgs', multi_class='multinomial', max_iter=1000, random_state=42, n_jobs=16)\nle = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()\n\n\npipe = Pipeline([('tfidf', tfidf), ('lr', lr)])\n\n\npipe.fit(X_train, le.fit_transform(y_train))\n\nPipeline(steps=[('tfidf',\n                 TfidfVectorizer(max_df=0.5, min_df=2, stop_words='english')),\n                ('lr',\n                 LogisticRegression(C=100.0, max_iter=1000,\n                                    multi_class='multinomial', n_jobs=16,\n                                    random_state=42))])In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

Accuracy is highly sensitive to class balance, so let’s take a look at the class proportions of the test set:\n\npd.Series(y_test).value_counts(normalize=True)\n\nrec.sport.hockey            0.052974\nsoc.religion.christian      0.052841\nrec.motorcycles             0.052841\nrec.sport.baseball          0.052708\nrec.autos                   0.052576\nsci.crypt                   0.052576\nsci.med                     0.052576\ncomp.windows.x              0.052443\nsci.space                   0.052310\ncomp.os.ms-windows.misc     0.052310\nsci.electronics             0.052177\ncomp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware    0.052045\nmisc.forsale                0.051779\ncomp.graphics               0.051646\ncomp.sys.mac.hardware       0.051115\ntalk.politics.mideast       0.049920\ntalk.politics.guns          0.048327\nalt.atheism                 0.042353\ntalk.politics.misc          0.041158\ntalk.religion.misc          0.033324\nName: proportion, dtype: float64\n\n\nGreat, this means choosing the most common class would only yield 5% accuracy. We can also look at the literature and see that a much more sophisticated approach using Deep Learning achieves 89%, not that far from our simple bag-of-words + linear classifier. Now let’s take a look at some predictions:\n\npipe.predict(X_test)\n\narray([ 7,  1,  0, ...,  9, 12, 15])\n\n\nOh no, we’re getting numbers instead of actual classes. For deployment, we don’t want the classifier to spit a number between 0 and 19. If it’s a customer facing endpoint, we’d rather make an actual prediction a human can read. To do so, we will need to augment our pipeline with an inverse label encoder which maps numeric labels into topics strings.\nCreating new Scikit-learn transformers / estimators to do so is quite simple:\n\nclass InverseLabelEncoder(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):\n    def __init__(self, le):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.le = le\n                 \n    def fit(self, _, y):\n        self.le.fit(y)\n        return self\n                 \n    def predict(self, y):\n        return self.le.inverse_transform(y)\n\nSince the Logistic Regression will not be the last step of the pipeline anymore, we need to create an “Internal Logistic Regressor”, which behaves as an intermediary pipeline step i.e. it uses the transform method instead of the predict one.\n\nclass InternalLR(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):\n    def __init__(self, lr):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.lr = lr\n                 \n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        self.lr.fit(X, y)\n        return self\n\n    def transform(self, X):\n        return self.lr.predict(X)\n\nNow, all we need to do is create a new pipeline that is able to spit out a topic instead of a number:\n\ninv_le = InverseLabelEncoder(le)\nilr = InternalLR(lr)\npredict_pipe = Pipeline([('tfidf', tfidf), ('ilr', ilr), ('inv_le', inv_le)])\npredict_pipe\n\nPipeline(steps=[('tfidf',\n                 TfidfVectorizer(max_df=0.5, min_df=2, stop_words='english')),\n                ('ilr',\n                 InternalLR(lr=LogisticRegression(C=100.0, max_iter=1000,\n                                                  multi_class='multinomial',\n                                                  n_jobs=16,\n                                                  random_state=42))),\n                ('inv_le', InverseLabelEncoder(le=LabelEncoder()))])In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

Since this post-processing is part of the Scikit-learn pipeline, this means we can bundle all of it together in the deployment process. But first, let’s check we still have the same performance:\n\nprint(f\"Accuracy is {100.0*accuracy_score(predict_pipe.predict(X_test), y_test)}%\")\n\nAccuracy is 84.59904407859798%\n\n\n\nInterpretability with LIME\nBefore we get to the model deployment, let’s take a look at what the model is doing using LIME. It’s always important to develop an intuition for what the model is doing before using it.\n\nexplainer = LimeTextExplainer(class_names=test_dataset.target_names)\n\n\nlime_idx = 2\n\n\nexp = explainer.explain_instance(X_test[lime_idx], pipe.predict_proba, num_features=6, top_labels=2)\n\n\nexp.show_in_notebook(text=X_test[lime_idx])\n\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\nprint(f\"Actual class: {y_test[lime_idx]}\")\n\nActual class: alt.atheism\n\n\nWe can see that presence of keywords such as Atheism, God and Mathew (sic) make the model predict it’s an Atheism mailing list, which unsurprisingly is correct. The fact that we are using an email alias as a predictor shows the limitations of this model and dataset.\n\n\nPickle\nFinally, let’s save this model for deployment using Cloudpickle. Note that you cannot use the standard library Pickle in this case, since we created a custom class! Cloudpickle works the same way as the regular pickle, but it saves custom classes as well in the pickle. Note that pickles are in general an unsafe form of model sharing since they allow for execution of arbitrary code. Only open pickles of good provenance.\nIf pickling is infeasible or too unsafe for your use case, you can use a model serialization framework like the aforementioned MLeap and ONNX.\n\nfile_name = 'model.pickle'\n\n\nwith open(file_name, 'wb') as handle:\n    cloudpickle.dump(predict_pipe, handle)"

    "section": "Lambda",
    "text": "Lambda\nAs explained before, there are two ways to create a Lambda function: just zipping all the relevant files together or via a Docker image. The easiest way in general is using a zip file, but the standard Python image won’t contain the necessary libraries for ML such as Numpy or Scikit-learn. While possible to add the libraries to the zip, it’s easier to use a Dockerfile.\nWe just need to define a Dockerfile, a requirements.txt and the predict.py script that will actually be called by the Lambda:\n\nDockerfile: the Docker image definition\nrequirements.txt: the libraries used to train your model\npredict_sklearn.py: the script used in the Lambda function\n\nThe most interesting part is the predict_sklearn.py function:\nimport json\nimport cloudpickle\n\n# By loading the pickle outside `predict`,\n# we re-use it across different Lambda calls for the same execution instance\nwith open('model.pickle', 'rb') as f:\n    model = cloudpickle.load(f)\n\ndef api_return(body, status):\n    return {\n        'isBase64Encoded': False,\n        'statusCode': status,\n        'headers': {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},\n        'body': json.dumps(body, default=str)\n    }\n\ndef predict(event, context):\n    if isinstance(event['body'], str):\n        try:\n            payload = json.loads(event['body'])\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            return api_return({'error': 'JSON decode error when decoding payload'}, 400)\n    elif isinstance(event['body'], list):\n        payload = event['body']\n    else:\n        return api_return({'error': 'Unknown input format'}, 400)\n\n    # Scikit-learn needs a list or array as input\n    if not isinstance(payload, list):\n        payload = [payload]\n\n    try:\n        output = model.predict(payload).tolist()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return api_return({'error': str(e)}, 500)\n\n    return api_return(output, 200)\nMost of the function above is error handling. Essentially, we are loading a model pickle outside the function (so that it’s cached across multiple calls) and calling model.predict inside it.\n\nDocker image\nWe need to login to ECR (Elastic Container Registry), build the image, tag and then and push it to the registry. Then, this image will be accessible by any AWS service:\n\n# Log in to AWS ECR\nos.system(f\"aws ecr get-login-password --region {region} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin {account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com\")\n\n# Create ECR repo: only needs to be done once\nos.system(f\"aws ecr create-repository --repository-name {ecr_image_name} --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --image-tag-mutability MUTABLE\")\n\n# Build Docker image using your local Dockerfile\nos.system(f\"docker build -t {ecr_image_name} . --platform=linux/amd64\")\n\n# Tag you image\nos.system(f\"docker tag {ecr_image_name}:latest {account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/{ecr_image_name}:latest\")\n\n# Push your image to ECR\nos.system(f\"docker push {account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/{ecr_image_name}:latest\")\n\nLet’s finally create the Lambda function:\n\n# Set up the Lambda client\nlambda_client = boto3.client('lambda', region_name=region)\n\n\n# Function name (not public facing)\nfunction_name = 'lambda-fn-sklearn-predict'\n\n\n# Retrieve (if already exists) or create a new Lambda function\ntry:\n    response = lambda_client.get_function(FunctionName=function_name)\n    print(f\"Lambda function {function_name} already exists\")\nexcept lambda_client.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException:\n    response = lambda_client.create_function(\n        FunctionName=function_name,\n        Role=role_arn,\n        PackageType='Image',\n        Code={\n            'ImageUri': f'{account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/{ecr_image_name}:latest'\n        },\n        Description='SKLearn predict Lambda function',\n        Timeout=10,\n        MemorySize=256,\n        Publish=True,\n    )\n    print(f\"Lambda function {function_name} created!\")\n\nLambda function lambda-fn-sklearn-predict created!\n\n\nThe create_function returns instantly but the function will be in the pending state for a few seconds. To be sure, wait 30 seconds before running the invocation command:\n\ntime.sleep(30)\n\n\n# Prepare the event to pass to the Lambda function\nexample = [\"\"\"Did that FAQ ever got modified to re-define strong atheists as not those who \\\nassert the nonexistence of God, but as those who assert that they BELIEVE in \\\nthe nonexistence of God?\"\"\"]\n\n# Invoke the Lambda function\nresponse = lambda_client.invoke(\n    FunctionName=function_name,\n    InvocationType='RequestResponse',\n    Payload=json.dumps({\"body\": example})\n)\n\n# Get the response from the Lambda function\nresult = json.loads(response['Payload'].read())\n\nprint(result[\"body\"])\n\n[\"alt.atheism\"]\n\n\nGreat, now we have a deployed Lambda function that we can use to make predictions! The next step is using API gateway to wrap an endpoint around it."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We use a hierarchical Bayesian model to show how a simple pro-Trump bias has a huge effect on forecasting election results. See the discussion on HackerNews.\n\nUS presidential elections\nUnlike other countries, where presidential elections follow a simple majority rule, the American election follows a different set of rules that makes it very hard for outsiders to understand what is going on. However, the idea is quite simple: each state has a number of electoral college votes, totaling 538 votes across the nation. The winner candidate of each state election takes all of its electoral college votes (with two exceptions). If a candidate receives 270 electoral votes or more overall, he or she wins the election. This makes the election an interesting forecasting problem. Instead of predicting the total number of votes in each candidate, the problem is forecasting the results of each state individually.\nOur interest is not to forecast the 2016 election, which is not a random variable anymore (spoiler alert: Trump won). We want to show how a Bayesian forecasting model works, and propose a modification that explains why statistical models would fail so badly if there were polling biases.\n\n\nPolling\nIn theory, a poll should randomly sample the voting population. However, in practice there are several possible polling problems that can compromise their use in naive statistical analyses:\n\nShy Tory and Bradley effects: Voters are not comfortable with revealing their particular preference.\nSelection bias: People who answer the pollsters are from an unrepresentative subgroup (e.g. people who answer landline phones).\nStratification errors: Wrong subpopulation determination when doing stratified sampling.\nCandidate and (non)-voting correlation: As voting is not mandatory, the presidential preference of some people may be correlated with their chance of (not) voting.\nTemporal preference change: The preferences change over time (a lot of people make up their minds in the last week).\nSample noise: Any sample from a population will be noisy and its statistics will not be identical to the population statistics.\n\nSimple forecasts usually only consider the last item when estimating the margins of error or uncertainty. If you only consider this and nothing more, multiple polls will be treated as independent and unbiased, and the more polls you use, the smaller the forecasting errors will be, until there is almost certainty. The other effects are biases that will make the average of multiple polls unreliable and possibly useless. As they are not directly available for modeling, the only way to estimate them is by making strong assumptions or using polling results from previous elections. We do not attempt to model exactly those issues here, we rather include all of them in a bias term that is shared across all polls, and show that even a small bias term favorable to Trump completely changes the forecast.\n\n\nForecast\nWe leave the details of our hierarchical Bayesian forecasting model at the end, for the advanced reader. Now we show the results of its forecasts. However, depending on which polls we include, we have very different results. The polls to use in a forecasting model should be recent and of good quality (conducted with appropriate methodology and with past successes). As a proxy of quality, we use the grades from 538.\nWe found that the simple choice of which polls to use has a very large impact on the probability of victory of each candidate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling choice\nClinton\nTrump\nNeither\n\n\n\n\nLast poll with good grade\n87.3%\n10.5%\n2.2%\n\n\nPolls with the best 3 grades (over the last month)\n99.3%\n0.6%\n0.1%\n\n\nAll polls from last week\n100.0%\n0.0%\n0.0%\n\n\n\nWe consider polls with good grades to be above B, but this is not possible for some states, so we use a more tolerant definition in those cases. When we say last week or last month, we mean from the Election Day (Nov 8, 2016).\nBy aggregating the polls with different weights (e.g. according to their quality or distance from election), we would have endless forecasting possibilities, which explains the diversity found in the media before the election:\n\nNew York Times: 85% Clinton, 15% Trump\nHuffington Post: 98% Clinton, 1.7% Trump\nPrinceton Election Consortium: 99% Clinton\n538: 71.4% Clinton, 28.6% Trump\n\nOf the mainstream forecasters, only 538 cannot be included in the bucket of certain Clinton victory. Notice that the other forecasts are consistent with our own results shown in the previous table. How come the forecasters, including us, made such egregious mistakes? As in many statistical problems, the answer lies with the data: garbage in, garbage out.\n\n\nBias impact\nWe encompass all possible polling issues in a general bias term. We use a bias term that is favorable to Trump on election day because that is clearly what happened on November 8. This can be interpreted as a hidden preference for Trump that is not captured by the polls by all the issues explained before. Instead of fixing the bias to an arbitrary value, we use a uniform random variable. We start with zero bias, where Clinton is almost surely the victor, and increase its span until Trump is almost certainly the victor:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that even a small polling bias has a huge effect on the election forecast. This explains why 538 had a more favorable Trump forecast as they included a polling bias and did not treat the polls as independent samples, but this also indicates that even 538 probably underestimated the polling biases.\nYou can check for yourself how the bias impacts the results of each state election on the map below. For each state we forecast the predicted percentage of votes of each candidate, with varying bias:\n\n\n\nHierarchical Bayesian forecasting model\nWe can use a hierarchical Bayesian model to aggregate the information of each state poll to form a globally coherent forecast. Overall, each poll’s likelihood is modeled as a multinomial, with Dirichlet prior (per state) and uniform hyperprior (per nation). This way, prior information is shared across states and we can use weakly informative hyperpriors. We start with an overall national preference over each candidate, modeled as three independent wide uniform distributions:\n\n\n\nThen, we have the voting intention in each state, with the national preference as prior:\n\n\n\nFinally, each poll is modeled as one independent sample of the voting intention of the state:\n\n\n\nWe infer the posteriors of the unknown parameters (state voting intentions and national preferences) given the observed variables (the polls we decided to include). The posterior is our knowledge of the unseen variables after observing statistically related variables. Depending on the choice of which polls to include as observations, as we explained before, the posteriors and thus the forecast will be different.\n\n\n\nTo forecast the probability of each candidate winning the state election, we use the same multinomial likelihood that was used for the inference. However, now the voting intentions are the posterior given the polls, and number of voters is chosen to match 2012 election numbers. Thus, for each state we sample the predicted number of votes of each candidate on election day using the following formula:\n\n\n\nThe candidate with more votes takes all the electoral colleges of the state (we ignore the particularities of Nebraska and Maine). We sum the electoral colleges votes of each candidates, and if a candidate wins 270 votes or more, he or she is the winner. We repeat this process multiple times in order to determine the probability of each candidate winning the election.\nTo add the bias term in our forecast to account for all the polling issues already cited, we make a simple change to the predictive model:\n\n\n\nThis bias always stochastically favors Trump. We must subtract the same value from Clinton in order to guarantee θbias remains a valid probability simplex. In our experiments above, we vary ϵ from 0 to 5%.\n\n\nStan Code\nTake a look at our code and feel free to play with it. Here is how we implemented our model in Stan:\ndata {\n    int nb_polls; // Number of polls\n    int nb_states; // Number of states (51 because of D.C.)\n    int nb_candidates; // Number of candidates (3: Trump, Clinton, Ind.)\n    int polls_states[nb_polls]; // Poll -&gt; state map\n    int votes[nb_polls, nb_candidates]; // Polled votes for each candidate\n    int nb_voters[nb_states]; // Number of voters for forecasting\n    real bias; // Polling bias\n}\nparameters {\n    simplex[nb_candidates] theta[nb_states]; //1 - Trump, 2 - Clinton, 3 - Ind.\n    vector[nb_candidates] alpha;\n}\nmodel {\n    for(c in 1:nb_candidates)\n        alpha[c] ~ uniform(0, 1000); // Weakly informative hyperprior\n\n    for(s in 1:nb_states)\n        theta[s] ~ dirichlet(alpha); // Dirichlet prior per state\n\n    for(p in 1:nb_polls) // Multinomial observations (polled values)\n        votes[p] ~ multinomial(theta[polls_states[p]]);\n}\ngenerated quantities {\n    int votes_pred[nb_states, nb_candidates]; // Predicted number of votes on election day\n    real epsilon[nb_states]; // Bias random variable\n    simplex[nb_candidates] theta_bias[nb_states]; // Biased voting intentions\n\n    // The deltas below are used to ensure that the biased thetas form a valid simplex\n    real delta_t[nb_states];\n    real delta_h[nb_states];\n    real delta[nb_states];\n\n    for(s in 1:nb_states) {\n        if(bias == 0.0)\n            epsilon[s] &lt;- 0.0;\n        else\n            epsilon[s] &lt;- uniform_rng(0, bias); // Bias value for this state\n\n        // We must ensure that theta will remain a valid probability simplex,\n        // so we limit delta in a way theta will never be below 0 or above 1\n        delta_t[s] &lt;- fabs(theta[s][1] - fmax(0.0, fmin(1.0, theta[s][1] + epsilon[s])));\n        delta_h[s] &lt;- fabs(theta[s][2] - fmin(1.0, fmax(0.0, theta[s][2] - epsilon[s])));\n        delta[s] &lt;- fmin(delta_t[s], delta_h[s]);\n\n        theta_bias[s][1] &lt;- theta[s][1] + delta[s];\n        theta_bias[s][2] &lt;- theta[s][2] - delta[s];\n        theta_bias[s][3] &lt;- theta[s][3];\n\n        votes_pred[s] &lt;- multinomial_rng(theta_bias[s], nb_voters[s]);\n    }\n}\n\n\nConclusion\nWe have found that even a modestly sophisticated statistical model does very little to counter unreliable data. A proper forecasting model for the American elections must include polling biases, as we have shown in a general way. To arrive at a precise number, you must either make assumptions on the polling methodology, or calibrate the polls weights using their historical reliability. This could be the reason that 538 had Trump winning at the highest probability of the mainstream media. We have also to consider that when you forecast 70% probability of winning, the prediction is expected to fail 30% of the time, so it is hard to evaluate models and forecasters using only one observation.\nEven though the 2016 election was one of most surprising polling misses in recent years, the result was not a black swan. Nassim Nicholas Taleb pointed out, before the election, that the mainstream forecasts were not reliable due to their significant volatility. According to his model based on option theory, this volatility should have pulled the probabilities toward 50-50. As a follow-up, if there is interest, we want to explore a time-series model where the voting intentions follow a random walk. To do this, we need to change the underlying model to allow the unseen random walk influence the polling results. Following Andrew Gelman’s suggestion, we can change the Dirichlet prior to a softmax prior, and then we can make the softmax parameters follow a random walk.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis blog post was written with the help of Ramon Oliveira back when we were working in a data science consulting company (Datart) that we co-founded together."

Due to its simplicity and relation to typical NLP problems, name classification is a good candidate to experiment with different NLP technologies.\nWhen I heard a friend was working on a name classification problem as part of a hiring process, I went straight to ChatGPT to look for answers. I soon realised that ChatGPT can do a great job itself classifying names into entities with just a couple of examples (one-shot learning):\n\nNow, if I actually productionize that prompt using ChatGPT’s API, how would it compare to more traditional alternatives? In NLP, traditional might mean a model from just 5 years ago!\nIn this post, I explore four ways to classify names into person or company:\n\nBaseline using word counts and logistic regression: typical baseline for text classification\nFastAI LSTM fine-tuning (whole network): simple fine-tuning with few lines of code\nHuggingface DistilBERT fine-tuning (head only): more involved neural network training using PyTorch\nChatGPT API one-shot learning: only prompt engineering and post-processing are needed\n\nI use two public datasets available on Kaggle: IMDb Dataset for people names and 7+ Million Company Dataset for companies. Those datasets are large, with almost 20 million names! The choice of datasets was inspired by the open-source business individual classifier by Matthew Jones, which achieves 95% accuracy on this name classification task.\nFor simplicity, I sample 1M names for training and 100k for testing with a 50-50 balance between companies and people. Since we have balanced classes and ChatGPT cannot produce scores or probabilities (so we cannot use ROC AUC or average precision, definitely a big limitation of ChatGPT), I decided to use the accuracy as the main metric."

    "text": "Exploratory data analysis\nBefore I actually get to the fun part, let’s understand the data we have first. I have two hypotheses to explore:\n\nDo we see a different distribution of words per class? I’d expect some words like “ltd” to be present only in companies and words like “john” to be over-represented in names.\nDoes sentence length vary by class? I expect higher range for companies than people, as companies can be from just two characters like “EY” to mouthfuls like “National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak”. Alternatively, I could look at the number of words per sentence, since most Western names are around 3 words.\n\nAnyway, beware the Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names.\n\nwords_df = (\n    train_df.assign(word=train_df.clean_name.str.split(\" +\"))\n    .explode(\"word\")\n    .groupby([\"word\", \"label\"])\n    .agg(count=(\"clean_name\", \"count\"))\n    .reset_index()\n)\n\ntotal_words = words_df[\"count\"].sum()\n\nwords_df = words_df.assign(freq=words_df[\"count\"]/total_words)\n\nperson_words = (\n    words_df[words_df.label == \"person\"].sort_values(\"freq\", ascending=False).head(25)\n)\ncompany_words = (\n    words_df[words_df.label == \"company\"].sort_values(\"freq\", ascending=False).head(25)\n)\n\nFirst, let’s take a look at the word counts by label:\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nWe can see our hypothesis was right: Some words are quite predictive of being a person or company name. Note that there is no intersection between the top 25 words for people and companies. This insight implies a simple but effective baseline would be a model built on top of word count, which is what I do next. However, there is a long tail of possible names, so we have to go beyond the most common ones. Another way to see how the distributions differ is by sentence length:\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nCompany names tend to be longer on average and have a higher variance, but interestingly they both peak at 13 characters. I could use sentence length as a feature, but let’s stick to word counts for now."

    "section": "Baseline: Word counts + Logistic regression",
    "text": "Baseline: Word counts + Logistic regression\nLet’s start with a simple and traditional NLP baseline: word frequency and logistic regression. Alternatively, we could use Naive Bayes, but I prefer logistic regression for its greater generality and easier interpretation as a linear model.\nTypically, we use TF-IDF instead of word counting for document classification. Since names are quite short and repetitive words (e.g. “John”) are predictive, I believe it not to be useful here. Indeed, a quick test showed no improvement to accuracy by using TF-IDF.\nAnother varation is to use n-grams for either words or characters: they’re left as a suggestion to the reader.\n\ntext_transformer = CountVectorizer(analyzer=\"word\", max_features=10000)\nX_train = text_transformer.fit_transform(train_df[\"clean_name\"])\nX_test = text_transformer.transform(test_df[\"clean_name\"])\n\nlogreg = LogisticRegression(C=0.1, max_iter=1000).fit(\n    X_train, train_df.label == \"person\"\n)\npreds = logreg.predict(X_test)\n\nbaseline_accuracy = accuracy_score(test_df.label == \"person\", preds)\nprint(f\"Baseline accuracy is {round(100*baseline_accuracy, 2)}%\")\n\nBaseline accuracy is 89.49%\n\n\n89.5% accuracy is not bad for a linear model! Remember, since the datasets are balanced, a baseline accuracy without any information would be 50%. Now, whether this is good or bad in an absolute sense, it depends on the actual application of the model. It also depends on the distribution of the words this model would actually see in production. The datasets I used are quite general, containing all kinds of people and company names. In a real application, the names could be more constrained (e.g. only coming from a particular country).\nNow, let’s see what mistakes the model makes (error analysis). It’s always interesting to look at examples where the model makes the worst mistakes. If we have a tabular dataset, it might be difficult to interpret what is going on, but, for perceptual data a human can understand (text, image, sound), this leads to invaluable insights into the model.\n\ntest_df[\"proba_person\"] = logreg.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]\ntest_df[\"abs_error\"] = np.where(\n    test_df.label == \"person\", 1 - test_df.proba_person, test_df.proba_person\n)\n\ntest_df.sort_values(\"abs_error\", ascending=False)[\n    [\"clean_name\", \"label\", \"proba_person\"]\n].head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclean_name\nlabel\nproba_person\n\n\n\n\n60581\nco co mangina\nperson\n0.000206\n\n\n49398\nbuster benton and the sons of blues\nperson\n0.000984\n\n\n6192\nbest horizon consulting\nperson\n0.001613\n\n\n83883\nles enfants du centre de loisirs de chevreuse\nperson\n0.002633\n\n\n84646\nmanuel antonio nieto castro\ncompany\n0.997350\n\n\n32669\nchris joseph\ncompany\n0.996298\n\n\n8545\nhub kapp and the wheels\nperson\n0.004568\n\n\n77512\nmichael simon p.a.\ncompany\n0.994109\n\n\n71392\ndylan ryan teleservices\ncompany\n0.993017\n\n\n64777\nnetherlands national field hockey team\nperson\n0.007220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the mistakes are mostly understandable: There are many companies named just like people. How could the model know Chris Joseph is a company and not a person? The only way would be with information not available in the data I provided for its learning. We also see mislabelings in the people dataset: “netherlands national field hockey team” and “best horizon consulting” do not sound like people names!\nThis implies a high-leverage activity here would be cleaning the people dataset. If you want to make the data cleaning process sound sexier, just call it data-centric AI (just kidding: data-centric AI is actually a good framework to use for real-life machine learning applications where, in almost all cases, data trumps modelling)."

    "text": "FastAI LSTM fine tuning\nFor the first more complex machine learning model, let’s start with FastAI due to is simple interface. Following the suggestion of this article, I used an AWD_LSTM model which was pre-trained as a language model that predicts the next word using Wikipedia as dataset. Then, I fine-tune the model with our classification problem. FastAI fine-tune works in the following way: in the first epoch, it only trains the head (the newly inserted neural network on top of the pre-trained language model), then, for all subsequent epochs, it trains the whole model together. FastAI uses many tricks to make the training more effective, which is all wrapped in a simple function call. While convenient, it makes understanding what is going on behind the scenes and any customization more difficult.\n\nfastai_df = pd.concat((train_df.assign(valid=False), test_df.assign(valid=True)))\ndls = TextDataLoaders.from_df(\n    fastai_df, text_col=\"clean_name\", label_col=\"label\", valid_col=\"valid\"\n)\nlearn = text_classifier_learner(dls, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5, metrics=accuracy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn.fine_tune(5, 1e-2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.513145\n0.397019\n0.802810\n03:37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.167889\n0.137422\n0.952030\n07:53\n\n\n1\n0.157485\n0.145000\n0.956200\n07:50\n\n\n2\n0.122625\n0.139295\n0.963160\n07:53\n\n\n3\n0.112604\n0.112886\n0.968730\n07:53\n\n\n4\n0.111916\n0.111421\n0.970460\n07:53\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we ended with 97.1% accuracy, almost 8 percentage points higher than our baseline!

    "section": "Hugging Face DistilBERT classification head training",
    "text": "Hugging Face DistilBERT classification head training\nHugging Face offers hundreds of possible deep learning models for inference and fine-tuning. I chose DistilBERT due to time and GPU memory constraints. By default, Hugging Face trainer will fine-tune all the weights of the model, but now I just want to train the classification head, which is a two-layer fully-connected neural network (aka MLP). The reason is twofold: 1. We’re dealing with a simple problem and 2. I don’t want to leave the model training for too long to make reproducibility simpler and reduce GPU costs. I worked backwards from the previous results: Since FastAI took roughly one hour, I wanted to use the same GPU time budget here.\nTo only train the classification head, I had to use the PyTorch interface, which allows for more flexibility. First, I download DistilBERTs tokenizer, apply it to our dataset, then download the model itself, mark all layers as requiring no gradient (i.e. not trainable), and then train the classification head.\n\nbatch_size = 32\nnum_epochs = 3\nlearning_rate = 3e-5\n\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\n\nFirst, I apply the DistilBERT tokenizer to our datasets:\n\ntokenized_train_df = tokenizer(\n    text=train_df[\"clean_name\"].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True\n)\ntokenized_test_df = tokenizer(\n    text=test_df[\"clean_name\"].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True\n)\n\nNow, I create a PyTorch dataset that is the able to hand the input format given by the tokenizer (tokens + attention mask), alongside the labels:\n\ntrain_dataset = NamesDataset(\n    tokenized_train_df, (train_df.label == \"person\").astype(int)\n)\ntest_dataset = NamesDataset(tokenized_test_df, (test_df.label == \"person\").astype(int))\n\n\ntrain_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, shuffle=True, batch_size=batch_size)\ntest_dataloader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)\n\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n    \"distilbert-base-uncased\", num_labels=2\n)\n\nI set all the base model parameters as non-trainable (so that only the classification head is trained):\n\nfor param in model.distilbert.parameters():\n    param.requires_grad = False\n\nFinally, I actually train the model (see full training and evaluation code in the notebook):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch 0: test accuracy is 96.527%\nepoch 1: test accuracy is 96.776%\nepoch 2: test accuracy is 96.854%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe got 96.8% accuracy, essentially the same as FastAI LSTM model. This implies the extra complexity here was for nought. Of course, this problem is a simple one: If I had a more complex problem, I’m sure using a stronger pre-trained language model would give an edge relative to the simpler LSTM trained on Wikipedia. Also, by not fine-tuning the whole network, we miss out on the full power of the transformer. But this suggests that you shouldn’t write off FastAI without trying, which, as I show above, is quite simple.\nLet’s see which mistakes this model is making:\n\ntest_df[\"proba_person\"] = test_preds\ntest_df[\"abs_error\"] = np.where(\n    test_df.label == \"person\", 1 - test_df.proba_person, test_df.proba_person\n)\ntest_df.sort_values(\"abs_error\", ascending=False)[\n    [\"clean_name\", \"label\", \"proba_person\"]\n].head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclean_name\nlabel\nproba_person\n\n\n\n\n6192\nbest horizon consulting\nperson\n0.000008\n\n\n47006\nrolf schneebiegl & seine original schwarzwald-musi\nperson\n0.000326\n\n\n58512\ndevelopment\nperson\n0.000363\n\n\n9404\nxin yuan yao\ncompany\n0.999556\n\n\n59585\ncheng hsong\ncompany\n0.999490\n\n\n46757\ncompagnie lyonnaise du cin ma\nperson\n0.000550\n\n\n38224\npawel siwczak\ncompany\n0.999389\n\n\n25983\nsarah hussain\ncompany\n0.999311\n\n\n23870\nmanjeet singh\ncompany\n0.999295\n\n\n73909\nglassworks\nperson\n0.000776\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we see cases of clear mislabeling in the case of person and some tough cases in the case of company. Given the accuracy and the worst mistakes, we may be at the limit of what can be done for this dataset without cleaning it. Now, the final question: Can I get the same level of accuracy without any supervised training at all?"

    "text": "ChatGPT API one-shot learning\nI will use OpenAI’s API to ask ChatGPT to do name classification for us. First, I need to define the prompt very carefully, what is now called prompt engineering. There are some rules of thumb for prompt engineering. For example, always give concrete examples before asking ChatGPT to generalize to new ones.\nThe ChatGPT API has three prompt types:\n\nSystem: Helps set the tone of the conversation and gives overall directions\nUser: Represents yourself, use it to state your task or need\nAssistant: Represents ChatGPT, use it to give examples of valid or reasonable responses\n\nYou can mix and match all prompt types, but I suggest starting with the system one, having at least one round of task-response examples, then restating the task that will actually be completed by ChatGPT.\nHere, I ask for ChatGPT to classify 10 names into person or company. If I ask for more, say 100 names, there is a higher chance of failure (e.g. it sees a weird string and complains there is nothing it can do regarding the whole batch). If there is still a failure, I do a backup query on each name individually. If ChatGPT fails to provide a clear answer on an individual name, I default to answering “company” since this class contains more problematic strings.\nFinally, how can I extract the labels from ChatGPT’s response? It might answer differently, for example, by fixing a misspelling or by using uppercase instead of lowercase (system prompt notwithstanding). In general, it answers in the same order, but can I rely on that completely for all 100k examples? To be safe, I do a simple string matching based on the Levenshtein distance to match the names I query with ChatGPT’s responses.\nTo reproduce the code below, you need to have an OpenAI account and OPENAI_API_KEY set in your environment\n\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are a named entity recognition expert.\nYou only answer in lowercase.\nYou only classify names as \"company\" or \"person\".\n\"\"\"\n\ntask_prompt = \"Classify the following names into company or person:\"\n\nexamples_prompt = \"\"\"google: company\njohn smith: person\nopenai: company\npedro tabacof: person\"\"\"\n\nbase_prompt = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": task_prompt},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": examples_prompt},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": task_prompt},\n]\n\nall_preds = []\n\n\ndef get_chatgpt_preds(batch_df):\n    \"\"\" Gets predictions for a whole batch of names using ChatGPT's API\"\"\"\n    prompt = base_prompt.copy()\n    prompt += [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"\\n\".join(batch_df.clean_name)}]\n\n    openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n\n    try:\n        # Max tokens as 20000 is enough in practice for 10 names plus the prompt\n        # Temperature is set to 0 to reduce ChatGPT's \"creativity\"\n        # Model `gpt-3.5-turbo` is the latest ChatGPT model, which is 10x cheaper than GPT3\n        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages=prompt, max_tokens=2000, temperature=0\n        )\n\n        # Since we gave examples as \"name: class\", ChatGPT almost always follows this pattern in its answers\n        text_result = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n        clean_text = [\n            line.lower().split(\":\") for line in text_result.split(\"\\n\") if \":\" in line\n        ]\n\n        # Fallback query: if I cannot find enough names on the response, I ask for each name separately\n        # Without it, we'd have parsing failures once every 10 or 20 batches\n        if len(clean_text) &lt; len(batch_df):\n            clean_text = []\n            for _, row in batch_df.iterrows():\n                prompt = base_prompt.copy()\n                prompt += [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": row.clean_name}]\n\n                response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n                    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages=prompt, max_tokens=2000, temperature=0\n                )\n\n                row_response = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n                if \":\" in row_response:\n                    clean_text.append(\n                        [row_response.split(\":\")[0], row_response.split(\":\")[-1]]\n                    )\n                else:\n                    clean_text.append([row.clean_name, \"company\"])  # defaults to company\n\n        # To ensure I'm matching the query and the corresponding answers correctly,\n        # I find the closest sentences in the Levenshtein distance sense\n        batch_df = batch_df.copy()\n        batch_df = batch_df.merge(pd.DataFrame({\"resp\": clean_text}), how=\"cross\")\n        batch_df[\"resp_name\"] = batch_df.resp.str[0].str.strip()\n        batch_df[\"resp_pred\"] = batch_df.resp.str[-1].str.strip()\n        batch_df[\"dist\"] = batch_df.apply(\n            lambda row: lev.distance(row.clean_name, row.resp_name), axis=1\n        )\n        batch_df[\"rank\"] = batch_df.groupby(\"clean_name\")[\"dist\"].rank(\n            method=\"first\", ascending=True\n        )\n        batch_df = batch_df.query(\"rank==1.0\")[[\"clean_name\", \"label\", \"resp_pred\"]]\n        \n    # Catches all errors\n    # Errors only arise due to failures from OpenAI API and should be quite rare\n    # Ideally, we should keep retrying with exponential backoff\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Exception:\", str(e))\n        batch_df = batch_df.copy()\n        batch_df[\"resp_pred\"] = \"company\" # defaults to company\n\n    return batch_df\n\n\nchatgpt_num_workers = 32\nchatgpt_batch_size = 10\nsplit_size = len(test_df) // chatgpt_batch_size\ntest_batches = np.array_split(test_df, split_size)\n\nchatgpt_preds = Parallel(n_jobs=chatgpt_num_workers, verbose=5)(\n    delayed(get_chatgpt_preds)(batch_df) for batch_df in test_batches\n)\n\n\nchatgpt_preds = pd.concat(chatgpt_preds)\nchatgpt_accuracy = (chatgpt_preds.resp_pred == chatgpt_preds.label).sum() / len(\n    chatgpt_preds\n)\n\nprint(f\"ChatGPT accuracy is {round(100*chatgpt_accuracy, 2)}%\")\n\nChatGPT accuracy is 97.52%\n\n\nIncredible! With 97.5% accuracy, ChatGPT managed to outperform complex neural networks trained for this specific task. One explanation is that it used its knowledge of the world to understand some corner cases that the models could not have possibly learned from the training set alone. In some sense, this would be a form of “leakage”: perhaps ChatGPT would be weaker classifying companies founded after its cutoff date (2021).\nChatGPT is also quite cheap to run: the cost to classify the 100k examples was just under $5. It took 18 min to score all the examples, which could probably be improved by better parallelism. If you don’t use any parallelism at all, it will be much slower.\nLet’s see the raw responses ChatGPT gives:\n\nchatgpt_preds.resp_pred.value_counts().head(20)\n\nperson                                                                                                                            50955\ncompany                                                                                                                           48913\ncompany or person (not enough context to determine)                                                                                  13\nit is not clear whether it is a company or a person.                                                                                 11\nneither (not a name)                                                                                                                  7\nnot a name                                                                                                                            6\nit is not clear whether this is a company or a person.                                                                                5\ncannot be classified as either company or person                                                                                      4\ncompany or person (not enough information to determine)                                                                               4\ni'm sorry, i cannot classify this name as it does not appear to be a valid name.                                                      3\nneither                                                                                                                               3\nit is not clear whether it is a person or a company.                                                                                  2\nn/a (not a name)                                                                                                                      2\ni am sorry, i cannot classify this name as it does not provide enough information to determine if it is a company or a person.        2\nthis is not a name.                                                                                                                   2\nthis is not a valid name.                                                                                                             2\nperson (assuming it's a misspelling of a person's name)                                                                               2\nneither person nor company (not a name)                                                                                               2\nperson or company (without more context it is difficult to determine)                                                                 2\nplace                                                                                                                                 2\nName: resp_pred, dtype: int64\n\n\nFor the vast majority of cases, ChatGPT answers as I request: person or company.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Two weeks ago in Montreal, NeurIPS (formerly known as NIPS) took place, the world’s largest conference on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Major advancements in the field were presented, covering Deep Learning, GANs, and Reinforcement Learning, including both theory and practice. Over eight thousand people attended, more than a thousand papers were accepted, and dozens of workshops were held. Additionally, nearly all major tech companies were present, primarily aiming to recruit scientists and researchers.\nI went to NeurIPS to present the work Adversarial Attacks on Variational Autoencoders at the LatinX in AI workshop, co-authored by George Gondim, myself and our professor Eduardo Valle. At NeurIPS 2017, Prof. Valle presented two works we wrote together: Adversarial Images for Variational Autoencoders at the Adversarial Training workshop and Known Unknowns: Uncertainty Quality in Bayesian Neural Networks at the Bayesian Deep Learning workshop. It’s a great feeling to finally be able to present the work myself!\nSpeaking of LatinX, this year diversity and inclusion were the hottest topics at the conference. We had three other workshops dedicated to this (Black in AI, Women in ML, Queer in AI), as well as smaller talks and gatherings on the subject. Despite this, more than half of the Black in AI participants couldn’t obtain visas in time or were denied, which had some repercussions and may influence future conference locations. At LatinX, the Latin American artificial intelligence meeting Khipu was announced, scheduled to take place in Montevideo in November 2019. We Brazilians cannot miss this opportunity!\nThe conference had its issues: tickets sold out in just 11 minutes; last-minute name change (and we were left without mugs because of it); overcrowded sessions, with people being kicked out due to “fire hazards”; numerous audiovisual problems (it would have been better to watch many talks from home). Despite all of this, the experience is certainly unique: there’s no other place in the world where you might bump into Geoff Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun in the halls. Of course, they’ll always be surrounded by fans and people wanting to take photos!\n\n\n\nImagine you’re explaining your poster and Geoff Hinton appears behind you?\n\n\nAlthough these “celebrities” were present, their students were the ones presenting the academic work. With over a thousand papers at the main conference and hundreds at the workshops, it’s hard to know be aware of everything that happened there. I noted down more than 30 articles to review more carefully later. Although this is a large amount to read, it’s only a fraction of the total. For those who want a taste of what’s published there, here are some examples:\nBest papers (according to reviewers and program committee):\n\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations\nNon-delusional Q-learning and Value-iteration\nOptimal Algorithms for Non-Smooth Distributed Optimization in Networks\nNearly Tight Sample Complexity Bounds for Learning Mixtures of Gaussians via Sample Compression Schemes\n\nBest papers (according to me):\n\nRegularization Learning Networks: Deep Learning for Tabular Datasets\nBayesian Neural Network Ensembles\nThe Everlasting Database: Statistical Validity at a Fair Price\nHow to Start Training: The Effect of Initialization and Architecture\n\nBesides the academic side, NeurIPS has a strong social aspect: parties and gatherings. Excluding the official closing, the parties were all sponsored by companies. I attended two (Nvidia and Element AI), with excellent food and drinks. There’s a bit of elitism: I only managed to attend these two parties thanks to a friend who works with big names in a Montreal lab. However, every day there were several options, with varying degrees of difficulty to get a ticket.\nIn my opinion, the gatherings organized by participants through the conference app were the best part of the week, as they brought together people with similar interests and objectives. I attended AI for Business and AI in Production, both highly relevant to my work as a data scientist at Nubank. At those events, it’s possible to meet people from various backgrounds and profiles who share something with you, without the elitism of those exclusive parties.\n\n\n\nAI for Business lunch (I’m wearing purple in the top right photo)\n\n\nFinally, the last two days were dedicated to workshops. In them, you could delve deep into a specific topic and even learn about things not officially published anywhere yet. The workshop that left the greatest impression on me was AI in Financial Services. However, it had a strong bias toward North American and European realities, mostly discussing regulations and how machine learning could be done within these constraints. For example, in those countries, you need to explain the reasons for denying a loan, but how do you do that if the loan risk is calculated by a deep neural network? However, many countries like China, India, and Brazil don’t have such restrictions, so our challenges are different and were barely explored there. I can say that Nubank is at the forefront of applying machine learning to financial products globally.\nNeurIPS is an academic conference, not the best place to meet other data scientists, but rather the best place to find the top machine learning and AI researchers. I recommend the experience for those with an academic inclination, who have the habit of reading papers and plan to or have already published work in the field. If you have more practical interests, there are conferences and meetings that may be more useful professionally and more accessible, such as Strata, PAPIs.io or even KDD. The most important thing is to get out there and meet new people, but don’t forget to take some time to explore and enjoy the trip!"

    "section": "The hierarchy of needs",
    "text": "The hierarchy of needs\n\nBusiness\nBusiness sits at the base of the pyramid, as it’s the foundation everything is built upon. Directly or indirectly, data scientists must always strive to deliver value to the business. This way, we can impact customers positively, secure resources (whether human or computational), and advance in our careers. This pragmatic view may be discouraging for those seeking technical challenges only, but I propose that business challenges are more difficult and unique than those found in machine learning competitions.\nNo e-commerce company aims solely to predict customer churn; the real goal is to take actions that reduce churn among the most valuable customers. Credit risk assessment alone isn’t very useful; deciding who will receive credit and for how much is the core of many financial institutions. The probability of lead conversion is just the first step in prioritizing and allocating sales resources in a B2B company. In all three examples, the focus is on intervention (causality) rather than just prediction (machine learning).\nI worked on a document classification project where there initially seemed to be no complicated business issues involved; achieving sufficient accuracy would ensure the project’s success. After talking to the actual users, I realized that the classification rationale was more important than the decision itself. In the same place, a project had previously failed for considering only the model’s AUC without any concern for its practical use. We shifted our focus and delivered a system that was genuinely useful for the users and the company by investing more in the UI and less in the modelling.\n\n\nTarget\nThe target is what the model will try to predict, which may not be obvious at first:\n\nChurn: What should be the time window to define churn? What if the user becomes active again?\nCredit: How long must one go without paying to be a default? What if the collections team gets all the money back?\nSales lead: At what point in the sales funnel do we define conversion? What if there is a refund?\nDocument classification: What should be done with sub-categories? Can we group smaller categories into “others”?\n\nChoosing the target is the most critical step in modelling. No features or models can save an inappropriate target. On the other hand, having an appropriate target allows even very simple models (such as linear regression) with basic features to have some impact and already be deployed to production.\n\n\nEvaluation/Metrics\nEvaluation is the framework that objectively assesses how well a model will perform when deployed. The evaluation process should closely resemble what happens after the model’s deployment. While the standard holdout or cross-validation splits provide a starting point, they are generally insufficient. If the problem evolves over time (as is the case for nearly all business problems), a time-series split should be employed. If the target is censored for six months, there should be a six-month gap between training and testing. If the data contains groups and the model will make predictions for new groups in the future, you should use a group split.\nMetrics judge how well a model is predicting its target. It’s not uncommon to use more than one evaluation metric for the same problem. For example, in a binary classification problem, one might use AUC to assess how well the model ranks examples and log loss to evaluate whether the probabilities are well calibrated. It’s also common to consider business metrics, such as expected conversion rate or the number of credit approvals. These metrics are harder to estimate offline and generally require some assumptions or experiments. Although handling these metrics may be more difficult, they serve as a more powerful guide than traditional machine learning metrics. Plus, communicating results with people from other areas becomes much easier!\n\n\nFeatures\nFeatures are the inputs of the model. They need to be predictive of the target. It’s crucial to avoid leakage, meaning that when deploying the model in production, features must appear in the same way they did during training. I’ve encountered leakage in a conversion prediction project where I used features that only appeared when the user converted. In other cases, the values were missing. The model learned that missing values were never associated with conversions and achieved a 100% AUC. However, this model had no real value for the business!\nFeature engineering can be partially automated with tools like Featuretools. However, most of the work in creating new features depends on understanding the problem and the available data (including what can be crawled or purchased externally).\nAre more features always better? Not necessarily. More features may require more monitoring and engineering, which may not be a good trade-off in certain cases. It’s essential to balance the value of features (possibly with a business metric) with their operational and maintenance costs.\n\n\nModels\nIn the end, given the constraints of business, target, evaluation/metrics, and features, the choice of models narrows considerably. If the business requires interpretability of predictions, you shouldn’t use a neural network. If the target is continuous, you want a regression model, not a classification model. If the metric evaluates the calibration of probabilities, you want a model that can learn a proper scoring rule. If you have more features than examples, you want a model that can ignore most features, like Lasso regression.\nThe modelling process can be automated with tools like auto-sklearn or PyCaret, but only if it makes sense for the business. In some cases, gaining an additional percentage point in accuracy is less useful than having interpretable decisions, communicating with other areas about how the model works (including external regulators), training speed for “big data” cases, and prediction latency for real-time systems."

Always define a baseline first, which can be a business rule of thumb or a simple model (e.g. a linear regression or a decision tree classifier). The first proper model you build to compare against the baseline should be pragmatic, which depends on your domain:\n\nTabular data: Use LightGBM (watch my PyData London presentation here) or XGBoost\nTime series forecasting: Use Auto-ARIMA or Prophet\nText classification: Use word counts and Naive Bayes, TF-IDF and logistic regression, or ChatGPT API\nImage recognition: Use ResNet with transfer learning or ChatGPT4 API\n\nThis will handle the “model” part of the spiral and probably capture most of the gains. Use your time to focus on the other components before coming back to the model: deploy it as soon as possible, get feedback from the stakeholders, explore the failure modes (error analysis), and then go over the target-evaluation-metrics-features-model process again.\n\n\nAuto ML\nMachine learning automation operates only at the highest levels of the pyramid: primarily in modelling, followed by feature engineering and selection. The other needs are much harder to automate and are the biggest differentiators among data scientists since they depend on domain knowledge. Even in the modelling part, there are cases where maximizing a single metric does not capture the whole story:\nOnce, while I was in the process of updating models, an analyst noticed that there was a small sub-population where the new model provided predictions that made no sense. In terms of metrics, there was no doubt that the new model was better, but for the business, it was not good to make mistakes in this sub-population. In this case, since I was using a relatively interpretable model, I managed to discover the reason for the incorrect predictions (related to how the missing values were being handled) and could deploy an appropriate solution.\n\n\nMonitoring\nMonitoring a model in production should be done at all levels of the hierarchy. Monitoring is generally associated with evaluation metrics, but other needs should not be ignored. For example, in a credit card fraud problem, the target is generally censored for several months (since it takes time to determine whether fraud has occurred or not, as it is a manual process), meaning that metrics can only be calculated months after each model decision. In this case, it is important to evaluate how the target is changing over time (using proxies with shorter censoring), monitor whether the model’s output distribution remains stable over time, and whether the distribution of features remains the same, which is a significant challenge in itself. For more information on model monitoring, I highly recommend watching Lina Weichbrodt’s PyData Berlin presentation.\n\n\nKaggle\nIn the case of Kaggle, the entire challenge lies in modelling, feature engineering and evaluation. The metric and target are already given. The business aspect is not explicitly present. With this, we can see the limitations of Kaggle as training and evaluation for a data scientist who will work on real-world problems.\nKaggle is a great tool for its purpose and is highly valued in the selection process for some positions. However, a data scientist needs to go beyond this and try to tackle other types of problems, those that are not well-formulated and therefore are fertile ground for exploring targets, metrics, and the use of predictive models in decision-making."

However, I believe the points raised are relevant to many other data scientists, especially those coming from an academic background. I hope you can use the hierarchy of needs to better guide decisions made as practitioners or students in the field.\nThis blog post originally appeared in the Data Hackers Medium in 2019. Full disclosure: the translation was done with the help of GPT4. I reviewed the final text and updated some sections, since I’ve personally learned and grown a lot since 2019. I’m open to feedback or suggestions for more applications of the hierarchy of needs framework."

    "text": "Snippets FAQ\n\nQ1\nHow can I add event metadata to a Custom Bot? To add event metadata to a Custom Bot, ensure that the event is included in the trigger rules for the bot. Once the event is set as a trigger, the event metadata option will be available for use.\n\n\nQ2\nHow do I capture emails using a custom bot? To capture emails using a custom bot, create a Custom Bot and use the \"Collect Data\" option during the creation process. This allows you to update any default or custom attributes enabled in your qualification settings. Additionally, you can enable pre-built qualification Bots to automatically collect contact information during conversations.\n\n\nQ3\nCan I use variables in the bot, like using customer name and owner name? Yes, you can use dynamic attributes in the bot messages. When editing the message, look for the icon that shows the available dynamic attributes to select.\n\n\nQ4\nHow can I customize my bot’s identity and change the \"from\" name in emails? To customize your bot’s identity, such as changing its name and icon, follow the instructions in these articles: Customize your bot’s identity to suit your brand and Customizing Fin in the Messenger. To change the \"from\" name in emails, remove your workspace name from the sender name in a new message by setting up a custom email address and using that in the \"From\" field. The name will display exactly as specified in the Name setting for the address, and will not contain the name of your workspace. Set up a custom email address from your Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Outbound &gt; Outbound email addresses.\n\n\nQ5\nHow do I change the displayed name and greeting when responding to chat messages? To change the displayed name when responding to chat messages, you need to set up a custom email address and use that in the \"From\" field. The name will display exactly as specified in the Name setting for the address, and will not contain the name of your workspace. You can set up a custom email address from your Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Outbound &gt; Outbound email addresses. Please note that this will only impact new outbound messages, not replies in conversations.\n\n\nQ6\nHow do I add a privacy notice to my chat? You can add a privacy notice using the Special Notice tool in Messenger &gt; Conversations.\n\n\nQ7\nHow can I set up chat to be available only for users? If you’d like to adjust the visibility of the Intercom Launcher, go to Messenger Settings &gt; Show the Messenger Launcher and create a rule(s) based on the URL(s) you want to show the messenger. For example, the below rule would show the messenger only on the URLs that contains \"www.example.com\" or in your case you would use the toggle for Leads and the does not contain (add your help centre URL).\n\n\nQ8\nHow can I restrict access to the help center so that it’s available only to users and not leads? To restrict access to your Help Center so that it’s available only to users and not leads, you need to set up a custom domain for your Help Center that matches the top-level domain of your web app. This way, users who are logged-in on your app will not be seen as logged-out leads within the Help Center. Make sure you are using the Messenger in your product for logged-in users and have a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled. For more information on setting up a custom domain for the Help Center, refer to this article: Custom Domains for Articles.\n\n\nQ9\nHow can I control the visibility of the Messenger feature in my Help Center? To control the visibility of the Messenger feature in your Help Center, go to your Messenger settings and define who can see the Messenger and where it should be visible or not visible. Set the Messenger to appear for Visitors/Users that the current URL does not contain your Help Center domain. This means that if anyone is in your Help Center, they will not see the Messenger launcher.\n\n\nQ10\nHow can I remove the chat icon from the Help Center page? You can turn off the Messenger launcher on your Help Center from your Messenger settings. Follow these steps:. Go to the Messenger Settings and under the Web section \"Show the Messenger Launcher\" where you can edit the settings for Visitors and/or Users.. Under \"Show the Messenger launcher\", select \"add display conditions\".. Add the rule \"Current page URL does not contain [your help center domain]\".. Click \"Save and set live\".\n\n\nQ11\nHow can I customize the Intercom chat window in my help center? To customize the Intercom chat window in your help center, go to Messenger &gt; Show the Messenger Launcher. Here, you can control which types of website visitors or users may start conversations and make a variety of customizations, including who may receive the Messenger launcher based on specific attributes like your Help Centre URL. Don’t forget to enable it for Visitors and Users.\n\n\nQ12\nHow can I embed the Help Center as a page within my Web Application using an iFrame? We currently prohibit embedding the help center into an iframe to prevent clickjacking. However, your customers can access your help center in the Intercom Messenger’s iFrame by clicking on the ‘Help’ button at the bottom of the Messenger.\n\n\nQ13\nHow can I add an SSL certificate to my Intercom-hosted Help Center? Intercom does not natively host SSL certificates for custom domains in the Article Help Center. However, your default Help Center URL does have SSL enabled. To use SSL with a custom domain, you will need to use a 3rd party service like Cloudflare, which offers a flexible SSL service that acts as a proxy between the end user and your Help Center, ensuring that requests are routed over SSL.\n\n\nQ14\nHow can I ensure that the links on my custom domain help center use https instead of http? To use SSL for your custom domain help center, you will need to use a 3rd party service like Cloudflare. They offer a flexible SSL service that acts as a proxy between the end user and your Help Center, ensuring that requests are routed over SSL.\n\n\nQ15\nHow do we change http:// (insecure links) to https:// in our source code on any help section link? If you’ve already set up SSL on your Custom Domain, then you’ll also want to be sure you turn on the HTTPS setting in your Help Center Settings menu. You can find that under the ‘Domain’ section.\n\n\nQ16\nIf I change the URL of the help center, will it break all the existing links or will redirects be set up? If you change from one custom domain to another, the existing links will break, and you will need to manually redirect them from your DNS provider, as this cannot be done from our end.\n\n\nQ17\nHow does hosting the Help Center on a custom domain impact SEO and is it possible to update the custom domain with automatic redirection? Hosting the Help Center on a custom domain does not impact SEO. Your results will be indexed by Google’s search tool as normal, though it may take a little while for crawling to start. You can enable this setting under Articles &gt; Help Center settings &gt; Privacy &gt; ‘Allow your Help Center to appear in search results’. To update the custom domain, follow the steps outlined in the documentation with the new record. Automatic redirection is not provided by Intercom, as the record is configured on the side of your DNS provider. You’d need to speak to them about setting up such an automation.\n\n\nQ18\nCan Intercom automatically translate help center articles? Intercom does not have AI auto-translate available for Help Center articles. You would need to use an alternate tool or integration for your translations, such as the Unbabel integration, available for in-conversation translations.\n\n\nQ19\nIs there any way in Intercom to automatically translate our clients’ messages into English if they are in any other language? Intercom does not offer automatic translation. If you are communicating in two different languages on Intercom, you will need to use a third-party translation service. You can find some options in the Intercom App store, such as Lokalise, Transly, and Unbabel.\n\n\nQ20\nDoes Intercom have easy translations for incoming ticket/conversations? At the moment, Intercom does not have an option to automatically translate messages sent by your end-user. You can use any of the apps listed in the app store for automatic translation.\n\n\nQ21\nDoes Intercom support multi-lingual features, and can it integrate with language converter software like ConveyThis? Intercom supports English, German, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. We have an open API, so we can integrate with pretty much anything. We do not have a native integration with ConveyThis, but we do have other translator apps in our App Store, such as Unbabel and more.\n\n\nQ22\nWhat languages does Intercom support? Intercom supports the following languages currently: English, German, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. You can learn more about our localization features in the Help Center.\n\n\nQ23\nWhat is Intercom? Intercom is an online platform for businesses to make communication more personal. It provides tools for customer support, marketing, and sales.\n\n\nQ24\nWhat is Intercom? Intercom is an online platform for businesses to make communication more personal. It provides a messaging system for businesses to interact with their customers.\n\n\nQ25\nIs Intercom an open source? Intercom itself is not open source, but it does have an open source API. You can find the developer documentation at https://developers.intercom.com.\n\n\nQ26\nAre there plans to add Openphone as an integration or support inbound calling in Intercom? At the moment, there are no plans to support OpenPhone as an integration. However, there is an open beta for Intercom Calling that you might want to try out. Inbound calling functionality is not available yet, but the team is actively working on it.\n\n\nQ27\nAre intercom calls only outgoing or can we configure them to be incoming? At present, the Intercom Calls capability only supports outgoing/outbound calls to your customers. It’s not possible to set up this feature for incoming calls.\n\n\nQ28\nHow can I give feedback about Intercom? You can share your feedback with customer support, and they will pass it along to the product team.\n\n\nQ29\nHow can I report a bug or suggest a feature to Intercom? If you have a feature request or you suspect you’ve encountered a bug, you can share that with the Support Team right here in the Messenger.\n\n\nQ30\nHow do I report a bug or compatibility issue in the Intercom iOS SDK? To report a bug or compatibility issue in the Intercom iOS SDK, contact customer support and provide the following information: SDK version, OS version of the user experiencing the issue, URL of the user’s profile who is experiencing the issue, and any relevant crash logs. Any additional information you can provide will assist in resolving your issue quicker. The support team will investigate the issue and provide updates on the bug report.\n\n\nQ31\nHow can I provide feedback or request features for Intercom, such as dark mode for the mobile app? You can reach out to Intercom’s support team in the Messenger with your feedback or feature requests. There is no set timeline for how and when feature requests get reviewed, but new features are typically announced in the Newsfeed.\n\n\nQ32\nHow can I stay updated on Intercom’s latest updates and features? Keep an eye on our blog for the latest updates and features.\n\n\nQ33\nDoes Intercom provide RSS feeds for help centers and how can I stay updated on new features and changes in Intercom? Intercom does not currently support RSS feeds for help center articles. To stay updated on new features and changes in Intercom, keep an eye on the Product Changes page at https://www.intercom.com/changes/en for announcements on new features and updates.\n\n\nQ34\nIs it possible to get our news items via XML or RSS feed? It is currently not possible to update your Intercom News via XML or RSS feed.\n\n\nQ35\nHow can I show the newsfeed on Intercom if the news items are live and the news settings center is on, and what should I do if the newsfeed is still not showing even after checking the settings? Make sure that news is enabled on the messenger, otherwise news items will not be broadcast. You can do this by going to Messenger settings and turning it on.\n\n\nQ36\nHow do I create a news article in Intercom? You can create a news article by going to the Outbound settings and selecting \"All Messages.\" You should see the option to create a news item there.\n\n\nQ37\nWhere can I find data regarding NEWS action on Intercom Messenger in reports? Currently, reporting on news is not available. Intercom provides only a few reports which can be found in the help center.\n\n\nQ38\nDoes Intercom have the ability to produce reporting on Recent Page Views? It is not possible to report on recent page views. At present, it will only be possible to view a user’s recent page views via their user profile. This data cannot be exported or added to a report.\n\n\nQ39\nWhere should the tracked events be located in the dashboard? Events that you send to Intercom will show up in the Contacts page if you add them as filters. Also, you will see the events on the user’s profile page at the top-right under \"recent events\" and at the bottom-left under \"total events\".\n\n\nQ40\nHow can I monitor agent activity and chat assignment in Intercom? To monitor agent activity, you can find teammate activity logs under Settings &gt; General &gt; Teammate activity logs. This will help you track when an agent logged in to chat and other related activities.\n\n\nQ41\nHow can I run a report on agent availability and access teammate activity data? There isn’t a built-in report for agent availability in Intercom, but you can use the Teammate activity logs to export the data and analyze away vs active times. However, we cannot provide support with building custom reports like this outside of Intercom.\n\n\nQ42\nHow can I find a list of all activity types in the admin activity logs and check if a given agent is online/available at a given point in time? To find a list of all activity types in the admin activity logs, you can refer to this article under the section \"Which actions are logged?\". To check if a given agent is online/available at a given point in time, you can retrieve an individual admin using the Retrieve an admin endpoint, then check the value for the away_mode_enabled attribute in the response. If the admin is away, it will be set to \"True\".\n\n\nQ43\nHow can I identify reopened conversations within the Intercom API, including timestamps and the relationship between admin replies and assignments? To identify conversations that have been reopened within the Intercom API, you can use the statistics.count_reopens search field with the ‘search for conversations’ endpoint. For example, use the following query to find any conversation that has ever been re-opened at least once: { \"query\": { \"field\": \"statistics.count_reopens\", \"operator\": \"&gt;\", \"value\": 0 } }. To find the timestamp for when a conversation was first or last reopened, retrieve individual conversations and parse through the individual conversation_part, identifying all parts where part_type=open\n\n\nQ44\nCan I import previous conversations from email or CSV into Intercom? Intercom does not offer a feature to import conversations from external email accounts or CSV files. However, it is possible to create conversations on Intercom via REST API programmatically, but these will show up in your workspace as new conversations and require many API calls to create every reply within a single conversation.\n\n\nQ45\nHow can I export and report full conversations in Intercom? Currently, you can’t export multiple conversations at once from the Inbox UI. However, there are two workaround options: 1. Downloading conversations one-by-one by clicking on the three dots on the top right corner of a conversation. 2. Using the Conversations API to extract full conversations by listing the conversations and then using GET for individual conversation IDs. For reporting, Intercom stores conversation data for two years, and you can refer to the Conversations report to optimize your support by tracking your team’s workload, understanding customer issues, and analyzing conversations by tags, channels, origin, and more.\n\n\nQ46\nHow can I export conversation content to a CSV file, and where can I find the option to do so? To export conversation content to a CSV file, you’ll need to use the Intercom REST API. The option to export conversation content is not available directly in the Intercom interface. can search for conversations that match your filters using the /conversation endpoint’s ‘search conversations’ call. Then, loop through the returned conversations and make a ‘retrieve a conversation’ call for each one. This will return the full conversation object, including all of the conversation_parts that hold the text of the actual chat.\n\n\nQ47\nWhy are some conversations not being included in the CSV export? Some conversations might not be included in the CSV export if they were started by your team and don’t have a customer/user response yet. For a complete set of conversations, you can use Intercom’s API to pull all conversations and their metrics.\n\n\nQ48\nCan I export a CSV of responses including the actual typed response from a customer? At the moment, it’s not possible to export full conversations through CSV. You can use the Conversations API to extract full conversations. You’d first have to list the conversations, and then use GET for individual conversation IDs.\n\n\nQ49\nHow can I export the content of a conversation? To export the content of conversations, you would need to use the Conversations API to extract full conversations. You’d first have to list the conversations, and then use GET for individual conversation IDs.\n\n\nQ50\nHow can I export conversation data and what should I do if I have an encoding error when exporting chat data? There are several ways to export conversation data: 1. Downloading conversations from the conversation menu, 2. Having a customer press the export button in the Messenger, 3. Exporting data about your conversations under Reports &gt; Customer Support &gt; Export, 4. Using the Conversations API to extract full conversations, and 5. Exporting Conversations data to Amazon S3 for Reporting and Analytics, Single Customer Views, Data Quality, and Governance. If you encounter an encoding error when exporting chat data, make sure you are using the correct application to view the exported data. If the issue persists, contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ51\nHow can I export conversations in a more formal format, such as PDF, for legal purposes? It is not possible to export the conversations in a PDF file directly. However, there are a few ways to export conversations: 1. By downloading conversations from the three dots on the top right corner of a conversation. 2. By having a customer press the export button in the Messenger. 3. Using the Conversations API to extract full conversations. After exporting the conversation, you can use a converter to convert the conversation from a .txt file to a PDF as a workaround.\n\n\nQ52\nHow can I export chat transcript history from a specific time period? Currently, there is no built-in way to export conversations in bulk. You would need to do so through the API one by one.\n\n\nQ53\nHow do I download closed conversations in a month? You can export conversation data by going to Reports &gt; Customer Support &gt; Export. Choose a range of dates, as well as any filters or field specifications that fit your needs. Alternatively, you can use the Conversations API to extract full conversations by listing the conversations and then using GET for individual conversation IDs.\n\n\nQ54\nHow can I see all my closed conversations? To see all of your closed conversations, click on the space in your Inbox where it says \"X Open\" and select \"Closed\" from that filtering list. You’ll be able to view all conversations in the active inbox (yours, a Team inbox, All, etc) by Closed.\n\n\nQ55\nHow can I view conversation data in the Inbox? To view conversation data in the Inbox, you can find it in the Details panel on the right as an app called ‘attributes’. If you don’t see this app, scroll to the bottom, click ‘edit apps’, and then pin the Attributes app.\n\n\nQ56\nWhy can’t I see conversations started via email in any of the inbox views? The issue might be due to the rules set for the inbox view. Make sure the rules are set correctly, using \"AND\" or \"OR\" as needed to match the desired tags. If the rules are set to \"AND,\" both tags need to be applied for the conversation to appear in the inbox view. If the rules are set to \"OR,\" it will be enough to match one of the tags for the conversation to appear in the inbox view.\n\n\nQ57\nWhy isn’t my inbox refreshing when new conversations come in? Try these steps: 1) Perform a hard refresh (Command + Shift + R on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows), 2) Test in an incognito browser (Command + Shift + N on Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows), 3) Test a different browser, and 4) Test an alternative wifi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phone. Additionally, clear your browser’s cache and cookies.\n\n\nQ58\nWhy are new messages not showing on the other end until they refresh? To troubleshoot this issue, try the following steps: perform a hard refresh (Command + Shift + R on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows), test in an incognito browser (Command + Shift + N on Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows), test a different browser, and test an alternative wifi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phone. Additionally, clear your browser’s cache and cookies.\n\n\nQ59\nWhat should I do if my messages disappear after typing and sending them? There are a few troubleshooting steps you can try to resolve or isolate the issue: - Perform a hard refresh (Command + Shift + R on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows)- Test in an incognito browser (Command + Shift + N on Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows)- Test a different browser than the one you’re using- Test an alternative wifi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phone- Disable any browser extensionsthese options and let customer support know if the issue persists.\n\n\nQ60\nWhat should I do if my messages disappear after typing and sending them? There are a few troubleshooting steps you can try to resolve or isolate the issue: - Perform a hard refresh (Command + Shift + R on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows)- Test in an incognito browser (Command + Shift + N on Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows)- Test a different browser than the one you’re using- Test an alternative wifi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phone- Disable any browser extensionsthese options and let customer support know if the issue persists.\n\n\nQ61\nWhat should I do if it takes a long time to send messages in a conversation? Try reloading the page, clearing the browser cache, and testing a different browser. If the issue persists, test on alternative networks and devices. If the problem still occurs, check for errors in the browser’s console by right-clicking the page, choosing Inspect, and clicking the Console tab.\n\n\nQ62\nWhat should I do if I’m having trouble with the Conversations interface? First, try a hard refresh of your browser. If that doesn’t resolve the issue, open an incognito browser and see if the issue persists. If it still persists, check for any errors in your browser’s Console by right-clicking the page, choosing Inspect, and clicking into the Console tab. Send a screenshot of your whole page, including the Console area. If the issue still persists after completing these steps, send a screencast/recording showing the behavior from when you click on \"Conversation\".\n\n\nQ63\nWhy is the chat not showing on my WordPress website after installing the plugin and adding a new brand? If the chat is still not working after following the initial troubleshooting steps, check your website’s console for any error messages. One possible issue could be that your domain has not been trusted for the Intercom app defined in the JavaScript snippet. To resolve this, go to your Intercom app’s Messenger Settings and ensure that your domain is listed in the trusted domains list. If you want Intercom to appear on all domains, you can choose to leave this list blank.\n\n\nQ64\nWhat should I do if Intercom isn’t showing up on my new website or after changing the domain? Make sure the new domain is added to the list of trusted domains in your Messenger settings. Save the settings and try reloading your website. If the issue persists, contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ65\nWhat should I do if my Intercom isn’t loading? First, try a hard refresh of your browser. If that doesn’t work, open an incognito browser and see if the issue persists. If it still doesn’t load, check for any errors in your browser’s Console by right-clicking the page, choosing Inspect, and clicking the Console tab. Send a screenshot of the whole page, including the Console area, to customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ66\nWhat should I do if Intercom is working slowly? First, try a hard refresh of your browser. If that doesn’t work, open an incognito browser and see if the issue persists. If the issue still exists, check for any errors in your browser’s Console by right-clicking the page, choosing Inspect, and clicking into the Console tab. Send a screenshot of your whole page, including the Console area, to customer support.\n\n\nQ67\nWhy is my Intercom slow? To diagnose the issue, check for errors in your browser’s console when the problem occurs. Access the console by pressing Ctrl-Shift-K or from the browser menu by clicking Menu &gt; Web Developer &gt; Web Console. Clear the console, show errors only, and try to replicate the issue. Any errors that appear in red can be screenshot and shared for further assistance.\n\n\nQ68\nWhy is my Intercom slow and unresponsive? To diagnose the issue, check for errors in your browser’s console when the problem occurs.

If a user is found with that email but with a different user_id, Intercom will create a new user\n\n\nQ122\nHow are Intercom IDs created and managed, and how can we prevent duplicate leads?

Intercom ID is your workspace ID, which is a unique code assigned to your app when you create it in Intercom. User ID is automatically generated for Leads. To prevent multiple entries of Leads collected via Banner signup, leads should merge into users based on certain conditions, such as matching email addresses or session cookies. However, if a user is created via API, the leads with the same email address won’t merge. Clearing browser session history or using a new device might also create new lead profiles.\n\n\nQ123\nHow can I manage merging users and handling duplicate user profiles in Intercom? It’s currently not possible to merge two Users in Intercom. You can merge a lead into a user, but you cannot merge two users. Duplicates can be created by using email and user ID inconsistently as unique identifiers.

Communication on a Ticket is now exclusively reserved for dialogue between internal teams who are working on the ticket. Frontline teams can talk to a customer about the Ticket via the linked conversation. It’s no longer possible to send replies to customers directly from the Ticket itself. Teammates can choose whether or not a Ticket should be shared with a customer when creating a Linked Ticket. Any Ticket can now be optionally shared with a customer (unless this has been restricted per the new Ticket type setting).\n\n\nQ128\nHow can I organize, automate, and manage conversations and tickets in Intercom? To organize and track information in conversations, you can use topics and tags. Topics are applied to the conversation as a whole, while tags are applied to specific messages within a conversation. To tag a conversation, select the tag icon next to the message, select ‘Tag Message’, choose the tag, and save. To automate actions based on conversation tags, you can create a rule to automatically close conversations with a specific tag, which helps route conversations to a certain Inbox or add an action, such as closing a conversation.

To set up a custom bot to be active only during working hours, go to the Schedule section of the Bot editor and set the hours for the bot. This will make the bot active only during the specified working hours. If you want to set another bot with different options to be sent only during off hours, choose \"Outside Office Hours\" for this bot in the Schedule section of the Bot editor.\n\n\nQ133\nIs it possible to set a bot sending hours to a specific team office hours? Currently, you need to use the ‘at custom times’ under the ‘Frequency and scheduling’ section to set the times for that specific team. There isn’t a direct feature to set bot sending hours to a specific team office hours.\n\n\nQ134\nHow do I set up inbox rules and custom office hours to manage message assignments based on time? To manage message assignments based on time, you can set up two different office hours and use those office hours to route messages to specific teams, such as a morning team and an afternoon team\n\n\nQ135\nHow can I set up different autoreplies depending on the time of day or day of the week for emails, and can I use custom office hours as a workaround? Unfortunately, there isn’t a built-in feature to set such specific rules for emails to be sent depending on the time of day. However, you can try using Custom Bots to create different replies based on the time when the customer starts the conversation. You can create several different Custom Bot actions (answers), each of them firing at different times (Monday morning, Monday evening, weekdays morning, weekdays evening, weekends, etc.). You can also choose who should receive these emails and which channel should be used (Messenger chat or email). Using custom office hours wouldn’t work for this purpose, as sending a particular email reply is not one of the options available when setting Inbox rules based on working hours.\n\n\nQ136\nHow can I schedule a chat response to go out at a specific time on a day?

Intercom does not provide an exact \"back at 4pm\" or \"Back in an hour\" message for breaks during office hours. Instead, when you have a break scheduled in your office hours, the reply time message will show as \"Our usual reply time 🕒 is A few minutes\".\n\n\nQ139\nHow can I track the duration of a call in Intercom? After the call has ended, a note will be posted on the conversation which includes the time of the call.\n\n\nQ140\nHow can I find out who closed a conversation in Intercom?

These events are hidden by default but can be made visible when you want to view them in the conversation by pressing ⌘/Ctrl E.\n\n\nQ141\nHow do I know who assigned the conversation to me in Intercom? If you enable your conversation events, you should be able to see the assignment action that resulted in the conversation being assigned to you. To show or hide the events in a conversation, you can use the shortcut ⌘E on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+E on Windows, or select the three dots at the top of the conversation and choose \"Show conversation events\".\n\n\nQ142\nHow can I manage conversation reassignment and inbox access in Intercom? To access Inbox Rules, go to Settings &gt; Inbox Settings &gt; Inbox Rules. If you see that the previous assignee no longer has inbox access when they do, it may be because you removed the inbox seat of a teammate, removed the teammate from the workspace altogether, or deleted a team which these conversations were assigned to at the time of deletion. When a team is deleted or a teammate loses inbox access, the system automatically reassigns conversations. To manually reassign conversations, use the conversation search and filters to find the affected conversations and reassign them to the appropriate teammate or team.\n\n\nQ143\nHow do I control the concurrency of chats in Intercom? You can control the concurrency of chats by setting an assignment limit for your workspace. Go to Settings &gt; Inbox Settings &gt; Workload Management, and define a workspace level assignment limit that applies to all teammates.\n\n\nQ144\nHow can I prevent duplicate conversations and email threading issues in Intercom? Duplicate conversations and email threading issues are often caused by the customer’s email client stripping out headers from emails, which Intercom uses to thread replies into a singular conversation. When headers are stripped, a new conversation is created because the system does not recognize and match the conversation with the original message. To prevent this issue, you may want to ask users to log in and chat via Messenger if you’re having a lot of back and forth with them. Additionally, for emails to thread properly in Intercom, they must have the same people in the recipients as the original conversation. If the recipient is updated, replying to the same thread creates a new conversation rather than threading to the existing one.\n\n\nQ145\nHow to read all conversations who share the same tag? You can use the Inbox search to filter for any conversations with a specific tag. You can read more about that search functionality in the Intercom help documentation.\n\n\nQ146\nHow can I manage tags in Intercom, specifically removing tags from conversations? There isn’t an inbox rule action for ‘removing tags’ from a conversation. However, you can use the REST API to remove tags from conversations.\n\n\nQ147\nHow can I delete a specific message in Intercom due to its vulgarity? Currently, it is not possible to delete a specific message in Intercom. However, you can delete a conversation by archiving or deleting the user attached to the conversation. Users or leads can be archived directly from your Contacts list. Archiving acts as a soft delete, so if the person returns (by logging in or being manually added), all data will be restored, including all associated conversations. To permanently remove all data associated with a user or lead, go to Settings &gt; [Workspace name] Data &gt; Deleting people data to delete them individually or use our REST API to delete users in bulk.\n\n\nQ148\nWhat permission do I need to edit or delete my message on Intercom? You will need the \"Can delete replies and notes from a conversation\" Inbox permission in order to delete a reply from within a conversation. You will need to have one of your teammates with permissions to access settings adjust that for you.\n\n\nQ149\nHow can I create and manage saved replies (Macros) in Intercom and where can I find learning resources? To create and manage saved replies (Macros) in Intercom, you can do so in two places: 1. Use Command-K (Windows: CTRL+K) or the action icon in the composer and search for “Create new macro” or \"Manage macros”. 2. In your workspace settings, under Settings &gt; Intercom Data &gt; Macros (Saved Replies). If you are unable to make changes in either location, you’ll need to request access from a teammate with the ability to edit permissions. This can be updated under Settings &gt; General &gt; Teammates. To learn more about Macros, check out this 2-minute video and our free Academy course which has best practices and examples. We also have an article with more information.\n\n\nQ150\nHow can I create and use Macros in Intercom? You can create Macros by following this video tutorial or take the Academy course for best practices and examples.\n\n\nQ151\nHow can I effectively use Macros in my Intercom subscription? To effectively use Macros in your Intercom subscription, create them to set up pre-existing support content and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks. You can learn how to create Macros by watching this video and taking the Academy course for best practices and examples.\n\n\nQ153\nWhy are the scheduled emails on Intercom not going out and how can I use Macros to improve my team’s efficiency? To resolve issues with scheduled emails not going out, check the schedule settings for the email. It might be set for a future date and time, which is why it hasn’t been sent out yet. To improve your team’s efficiency using Macros, you can set up pre-existing support content to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks. Watch this video to learn how to create Macros, or take this Academy course for best practices and examples.\n\n\nQ154\nWhat IP address does Intercom send emails from? Intercom sends emails from a few different IPs. You can get a list of the current IPs by using the following command in a terminal window: dig all.mail.intercom-mail.com +short\n\n\nQ155\nHow do we identify what email address is being routed to Intercom? You can see where an email is coming from by looking at the headers of the email. You can find those by hovering over the envelope icon at the bottom of the message in your inbox. Then click on the ‘View raw email’ link. The ‘From’ header should show you where the email is coming from.\n\n\nQ156\nHow can I set up email forwarding to Intercom for a specific email address? To set up email forwarding from your email client to Intercom, use the steps described in the email forwarding settings page in Intercom. You can find it at Settings &gt;&gt; Email &gt;&gt; Email forwarding.\n\n\nQ157\nHow do I set up email forwarding? To set up email forwarding, make sure you have Intercom’s default email address added to your email forwarding settings for your external email inbox. Your default Intercom email address can be found under App Settings &gt; Outbound &gt; Addresses & domains. Follow the instructions provided by your email client to configure forwarding settings.\n\n\nQ158\nHow can I use Email Forwarding in Intercom? Using Intercom to receive inbound emails can be helpful if you want to have a traditional support email address for customers to reach out to you through, and have those emails appear directly in your Intercom Inbox. You can follow this guide on Email Forwarding or take a free Academy course for a more interactive format.\n\n\nQ160\nHow do I change the email forwarding in Intercom? You can change the email forwarding by going to your Settings &gt; Emails &gt; Email Forwarding.\n\n\nQ161\nWhat could cause emails not being pulled into Intercom when using the forwarding email feature? To troubleshoot this issue, please provide the original headers of the email that didn’t arrive in Intercom. You can retrieve them from the message and paste the results into a gist and send the link for further assistance.\n\n\nQ162\nI have set up email forwarding but am not seeing all of the emails I expect to in my Intercom inbox. Can you help investigate? To troubleshoot issues with email forwarding, make sure that you have Intercom’s default email address added to your email forwarding settings for your external email inbox. Your default Intercom email address can be found under App Settings &gt; Outbound &gt; Addresses & domains. If you already have that configured and you’re still experiencing this issue, please send a screenshot of the forwarding settings in your email client so that we can see if there’s anything that might be off.\n\n\nQ163\nHow can I forward specific emails to Intercom to create a ticket for the support team with the sender as the requester, without forwarding all my emails? You can forward specific emails by sending/forwarding them to your Intercom existing email address. If this email has been linked to forward to Intercom, when you forward/send an email to that email, it should go to the Inbox for your support team. However, be cautious when forwarding emails from your personal address, as every member of your team will be able to see any emails sent to you. If you have private emails you don’t want visible in Intercom, it’s not advisable to forward emails from your personal address.\n\n\nQ164\nHow can I forward customer emails from a Google inbox to Intercom and assign them to a specific team? To forward customer emails from a Google inbox to Intercom and assign them to a specific team, first, ensure that you have set up email forwarding correctly. Then, in Intercom, go to your Inbox Rules and create a rule that assigns emails forwarded from a specific address to the desired team.\n\n\nQ165\nHow can I re-assign forwarded emails to a specific team in Intercom? You can set this up in your Inbox Rules. Create a rule that assigns new conversations with a specific email to the desired team.\n\n\nQ166\nHow do I assign all conversations to a specific team and ensure they go to my inbox if I’m the only member of the team? Create an Inbox rule to assign conversations to the team inbox. If you’re the only member of the team, all conversations will automatically go to your inbox.\n\n\nQ167\nHow can I organize my inboxes based on different support emails and set up Team Inboxes with automated rules to route conversations to the right team? To separate messages coming from two different support emails into two different inboxes, create two separate Inbox rules for each support address to redirect chats to the right Inbox based on the \"email to\" address. To set up Team Inboxes and automated rules to route conversations to the right team, follow this guide for setting up Team Inboxes and this guide for creating automated rules to route conversations.\n\n\nQ168\nHow can I divide chats and emails to different groups of agents in the inbox? You can use assignment rules to automatically assign new conversations to a specific team or teammate based on criteria that you set. This criteria can consist of user attributes, the page the user/lead is viewing, or specific keywords in their initial message. To do this, create assignment rules that direct certain messages to the inboxes you have specified. For example, you can route people writing in from your pricing page to the \"Sales\" inbox, users with accounts spending more than a specified dollar amount to a \"VIP\" inbox, or people using specific keywords to different teams.\n\n\nQ169\nHow can I filter customer emails to the correct inbox? To filter customer emails to the correct inbox, you can assign the customer to a teammate or team from the chat.\n\n\nQ170\nHow can I create and manage custom inbox views for a team? You can create inbox views for a team by declaring a set of filters and pulling up all conversations that match in real-time. Your teammates can view and pin these views by clicking the pencil icon and searching. For more information on Inbox Views, check out the related help article.\n\n\nQ171\nHow can I find and use teammate activity logs for team members and Inbox actions? You can find teammate activity logs by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Teammate Activity Logs. You have the option to review the actions that have been taken by your team and can filter the results by date, teammate, or specific activity. This includes actions related to article editing (create, update, delete) and Inbox actions.\n\n\nQ172\nHow can I find information on when each teammate enables and disables their online status? You can review teammate actions by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Teammate Activity Logs. You have the option to filter the results by date, teammate, or specific activity.\n\n\nQ173\nHow do I track my team’s opened tickets and their progress, and how do I manage conversation assignment based on team availability? To track in-depth information about your team’s opened tickets and their progress, go to the ‘Reports’ section. You can filter according to the teammate you want to see information for, and it will display in-depth numbers. Alternatively, you can create Custom reports to refine your search. To manage conversation assignment based on team availability, you can use an Inbox rule or the ‘Reassign replies’ option, which reassigns the conversation automatically when a teammate is offline. Each teammate will have to enable this when they are going offline.\n\n\nQ174\nHow can I create a rule to assign a conversation to a team only after a ticket is submitted, and can closed conversations be reopened if a customer submits a ticket later? You can create a rule to assign a conversation to a team only after a ticket is submitted using Inbox rules. Go to Settings -&gt; Inbox settings -&gt; Inbox rules to create the rule.\n\n\nQ175\nHow can I automate assigning emails and providing options for users when there is no response after a certain time? You can use the Apply Rules Action to set conditions for specific actions, such as marking a conversation as a priority, assigning it to a specific Inbox, or tagging the conversation. Additionally, consider using Custom Bots, which can proactively start conversations, provide clear answers, and work in the background to automate your teammate experience. This way, if there is no response after a certain time, the bot can suggest an article or assign a ticket to the user.\n\n\nQ176\nHow can I ensure conversations are assigned to teammates based on the time they come in, with priority given to conversations started first? To prioritize conversations based on the time they come in, you can adjust your workload management settings and rules. Make sure your office hours are set correctly, as this can affect the assignment of conversations.\n\n\nQ177\nHow can I fix the issue of conversations being assigned to the wrong person based on office hours? Check the assignment priority and working hours for each team member. Make sure there is no overlap in the schedule, and set the assignment priority accordingly to ensure conversations are assigned to the correct person.\n\n\nQ178\nWhy is round robin not assigning tasks correctly and why won’t conversations manually assigned to a team inbox automatically get assigned to active teammates? There could be several reasons why round robin is not assigning tasks correctly: 1. Round robin doesn’t account for teammates’ assignment limits. If you need to consider assignment limits, consider using balanced assignment instead. 2. Conversations are only assigned once when they arrive in a team inbox. If a teammate is unassigned, round robin won’t run again to find another teammate. 3. If all teammates are away when a conversation is assigned to a round robin team inbox, it won’t automatically get assigned to teammates when they become active. Conversations manually assigned to a team inbox won’t automatically get assigned to active teammates because round robin is designed to assign conversations only once when they arrive in a team inbox. If you need to reassign conversations, you may need to do so manually or explore other assignment methods.\n\n\nQ179\nHow does Round Robin work and what should I do if it’s not working properly? Round Robin is a rule applied to team inboxes that continuously assigns new conversations to active teammates in a sequential order, regardless of capacity, until a teammate sets themselves as \"Away\". There is not a way to create an order on how Round Robin distributes conversations. For Support teams, we recommend using balanced assignment. Make sure both teammates are in the same teammate Inbox. If the issue persists, contact customer support for further investigation.\n\n\nQ180\nHow does Round Robin work with Google Calendar for team availability? When setting up Google Calendar with a team using Round Robin, the app will send the calendar of the person next in line to have a conversation assigned - so the end user will just see a specific teammate’s calendar, not the team’s. Each person in the Round Robin team must connect their calendar individually for this to work.\n\n\nQ181\nDoes the round robin assignation system of live chat take into account the number of active chats in the inbox of the customer service agent? The round robin assignation system typically assigns one chat to one agent and the next chat to the next agent, regardless of the number of chats they had previously on their account.\n\n\nQ182\nCan I set agent chat limit? If you’re using Balanced assignment as your teammate assignment method, you can set a chat limit for each teammate and for a Team. However, this option doesn’t apply for Round Robin or manually pulling conversations. When balanced assignment is enabled, conversations are automatically assigned to teammates up to their assignment limit. Teammates with open conversations equal or above their assignment limit don’t receive more conversations. You can define a workspace level assignment limit that applies to all teammates in Settings &gt; Inbox Settings &gt; Workload management.\n\n\nQ183\nHow does activating balanced assignment and setting an assignment limit affect existing conversations and assignment of new conversations? When balanced assignment is enabled, conversations wait in the team inbox until an eligible teammate is available to receive more conversations. Eligible teammates meet certain criteria, such as being a member of the team inbox, having an active status, and having open conversations less than the assignment limit. If the volume is higher than the limit, teammates won’t be assigned more conversations. Assignment limits treat chat conversations and emails exactly the same. If the assignment limit is reached, teammates won’t be assigned more conversations. However, the \"Pull conversation\" button doesn’t account for the assignment limit and can assign conversations even if teammates are at their limit.\n\n\nQ184\nHow is workload management handled when there are multiple inboxes and teammates with conversation caps? When multiple conversations arrive within a short timespan, they will be sent out to teammates who are below the conversation limit in their inbox, based on the workload management settings. Conversations are assigned based on inbox priority, conversation priority, SLA status, and waiting time. The teammate who has been awaiting conversations the longest will be assigned the conversations first if both teammates are active.\n\n\nQ185\nHow can I access and manage Inbox Rules and control conversation reassignment? To access and manage Inbox Rules, go to Settings &gt; Inbox Settings &gt; Inbox Rules. If you need help getting started with Inbox Rules, check out the available help articles. To control conversation reassignment, go to Teammate settings, click Edit on the teammate you want to modify the settings for, and uncheck \"Can reassign conversations and edit lead or user ownership.\" This will prevent the teammate from reassigning conversations from their inbox. However, they will still be able to assign conversations from team inboxes and the Unassigned inbox.\n\n\nQ186\nHow can I limit a teammate’s permissions to only view incoming conversations and not edit, delete, or create new Outbound messages, and is there a permission to explicitly limit the ability to view Outbound messages? There isn’t a permission to explicitly limit the ability to view Outbound messages. The most limited you can make their permissions is by setting the \"Can bulk message visitors, leads and users\" permission to off. This will limit them from being able to edit and set live/save edits for outbound messages but it will not stop them from being able to view those messages.\n\n\nQ187\nHow can I change permission to prevent a teammate from closing conversations? You can restrict the level of conversation access for that teammate, but you can’t get as granular as restricting certain functions like snooze or close once they have access. However, you can restrict conversation access from the Teammate settings page once you click to edit a user.\n\n\nQ188\nWhat does \"Closed by teammate\" mean? \"Closed by teammate\" refers to the number of conversations a teammate has closed. Whenever a teammate closes a conversation, this number will increase.\n\n\nQ189\nDoes the Conversations report show all conversations during a period of time or an average? The number in the Conversations report represents the number of new conversations for your entire workspace during that time period, without any filters applied. \"New Conversations\" means brand new conversations that were started in the date range you have applied and have a teammate reply.\n\n\nQ190\nWhat is the difference between New Conversations and New Inbound Conversations in the reports? New conversations’ refers to the number of new conversations started, grouped by the date the conversation was created at. This counts any conversation with an end user reply. ‘New inbound conversations’ is the number of new conversations started by an inbound message, not in reply to a message or bot. This is when a customer opens your Messenger and starts a new conversation with you.\n\n\nQ191\nWhat’s the difference between new conversation and new inbound conversation in reports? New conversations’ refers to the number of new conversations started, grouped by the date the conversation was created at. This counts any conversation with an end user reply. ‘New inbound conversations’ is the number of new conversations started by an inbound message, not in reply to a message or bot. So this is when a customer opens your Messenger and starts a new conversation with you.\n\n\nQ192\nHow do you define \"conversation\" in Reports, and how is the \"Conversation handling time\" metric tallied up? Conversation handling time is when a conversation is open and assigned to any human teammate. It excludes the time that bots spend handling conversation, the time a conversation is in a team inbox and not assigned to a teammate, the time a conversation is snoozed, and the time a conversation is closed. A conversation handling time is counted once a conversation is closed, and re-opening and closing a conversation affects its handling time. For example, if a conversation is handled by Rep A for 5 mins and by Rep B for 10 mins, the conversation handling time is 15 mins (5 mins + 10 mins).\n\n\nQ193\nWhich message is considered as the first response time in a conversation? The First Response Time (FRT) is grouped by conversation creation date. Even though the time is only counted within office hours (when ‘Calculate your team’s response metrics within office hours only’ has been enabled in Office Hours settings), this will be displayed on the chart according to the time the conversation was created. For example, if a conversation is created at 4am GMT, but office hours are set to 9am - 6pm GMT, and the conversation receives a first reply at 9:30am GMT, reporting will show a 30min FRT for this particular conversation that was created at 4am, because it was answered 30mins after office hours started.\n\n\nQ194\nHow is the First Response Time metric measured? The First Response Time is the time from when the conversation was started until the time of the first response from a teammate. You have the option of including or excluding the bot time from the FRT. If you create a custom report, you can filter the conversation based on when the conversation was started or when the first reply was sent.\n\n\nQ195\nHow can I calculate the first response time from when someone chooses to speak with a live agent, instead of when they start the chat with a bot? To exclude time customers spent interacting with a bot from your First Response Time (FRT) reporting, you need to turn on the dedicated bot inbox. Go to Automation &gt; Settings, and switch the toggle \"On\". The name of the bot inbox will depend on the bot identity your workspace has set up.\n\n\nQ196\nWhat is a good response time for live chat? A good response time can vary depending on customer volume, team size, and other factors. However, under a minute is considered quick, and under 2 minutes is more plausible and healthy for most businesses. Keep in mind that responses can also be sent automatically to a customer’s email if they’re not around the messenger after 2 minutes.\n\n\nQ197\nWhat is the expected time for email delivery? When you set a new message live, we match and send the emails immediately; however, it’s currently expected that larger email audiences will take a bit longer to finish sending. This is because we process emails in multiple queues – the first 1,000 go out pretty quickly so you can tell the message is working, then, the remainder of the emails are sent out over the course of a few hours. The exact time frame depends on the current queue status, as well as the total size of the email audience.\n\n\nQ198\nHow can I ensure that notifications are always sent by email when customers message us? If a customer contacts you via email, your response will automatically be sent to their email. If a customer contacts you via Messenger, your answers will go via Messenger. You can set up email notifications for inactive customers who haven’t seen your response in Messenger for more than 2 minutes. This can be set in the Settings menu -&gt; Email -&gt; Email notifications.\n\n\nQ199\nCan you please clarify in which cases do customers receive an email, when the conversation was initiated via chat? Customers will receive an email notification if they have not seen the message in the Messenger after 2 minutes. For instance, if you reply to a user’s conversation in the Inbox and they don’t view your response in the Messenger after two minutes, the response is automatically delivered to the user via email.\n\n\nQ200\nWhy do clients sometimes not see chat messages and how can this be resolved? Clients might not see chat messages if they don’t check the Messenger first, causing the system to send the response as an email or push notification. If the client still doesn’t see the reply when opening the chat, it might require a refresh of the page. Ensure that the client has a stable internet connection and is using a compatible browser.\n\n\nQ201\nHow can a customer fix the unread chats indication issue and is there a limit to the number of chats a customer can see? If a customer can’t remove the unread chats indication on the chat bubble, they should first try to hard refresh their browser. If that doesn’t work, they can open an incognito browser and check if the Messenger launcher shows the correct number of unread conversations. Regarding chat history limits, all messages are saved indefinitely, so there is no cap for the amount a user can see. Users can scroll through all their conversations and messages, and keep loading more in the list if they have a lot.\n\n\nQ202\nHow can a customer resolve the issue of not being able to remove the unread chats indication on the chat bubble? First, ask the customer to hard refresh their browser and see if that resolves the issue. To do a hard refresh on macOS for Chrome/Firefox, hit Command-Shift-R. For Safari, press Command-Option-R. To perform a hard browser refresh on Windows for Chrome, press Ctrl-F5. If hard refreshing the browser doesn’t work, ask the customer to open an incognito browser and see if the Messenger launcher shows the correct number of unread conversations. Request a screenshot of the messenger open so you can see their conversations.\n\n\nQ203\nHow can I control the visibility of the messenger on my website? To control the visibility of the messenger on your website, go to your Intercom settings and define the conditions for the URLs where you don’t want the messenger to appear. Make sure to toggle the switch for both Visitor and Users to prevent all customers, both signed in and out, from using the messenger on these URLs.\n\n\nQ204\nHow can I disable the messenger for visitors on mobile devices? To disable the Intercom messenger for visitors on mobile devices, follow these steps:. For mobile web version (browsers): Go to Messenger Settings &gt; Control your inbound conversation volume &gt; Show the Messenger launcher and add filters for visitors.. For mobile apps (iOS and Android): Hiding the launcher from appearing on your mobile app, where you have installed an Intercom mobile SDK, will involve some extra development work. Follow the instructions provided for each platform: - For iOS: [Instructions for hiding Messenger on iOS]- For Android: [Instructions for hiding Messenger on Android]note that the actual instructions are not provided in this answer, but the links should direct you to the relevant information for each platform.\n\n\nQ205\nHow do I disable live chat on Intercom? To disable live chat on Intercom, go to Messenger Settings &gt; Web &gt; Show the Messenger launcher, and make sure to disable it for both Visitors and Users if you want to hide it for everyone.\n\n\nQ206\nHow can I hide the Intercom bubble from our application? You can hide the Messenger launcher by going to Messenger Settings &gt; Web &gt; Show the Messenger Launcher. Make sure to hide it for both visitors and users if you want to hide the launcher for all audiences.\n\n\nQ207\nIs it possible to implement the Intercom messenger code on one of our webpages so that the messenger collects logged in user information but does not show the actual messenger itself? Yes, this is possible! You can turn off the Messenger launcher within the Messenger settings page and can target the messenger to specific pages only. Once you’re at the messenger settings tab, head to General &gt; Messenger preferences.\n\n\nQ208\nCan Intercom be self-hosted? We are a cloud-based solution hosted by AWS so we don’t offer support for self hosting the Intercom script. You could theoretically add the javascript that is downloaded when the Messenger is loaded and host it yourself, but then you wouldn’t get the latest version of the Messenger whenever we update it. This is not something we’d recommend, as it’d be worse in a security aspect to have an outdated Messenger than to have it hosted in our CDN.\n\n\nQ209\nHow can I use Intercom on my website for the chat module and what plan should I choose for a small team with only live chat requirements? You can use Intercom on your website by signing up for a plan that suits your needs and then installing the messenger. For example, the Starter Plan might be a good fit for you. In the case of a small team with only live chat requirements, I would suggest going onto the Starter Plan that we offer. You can sign up here for free. If you feel it does not reach all your requirements, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.\n\n\nQ210\nHow can I create a form on my website that submits a conversation to Intercom? You can route form submissions into Intercom using our REST API to have those messages appear in your Inbox. At the same time, you can create the user if they don’t already exist, too. Additionally, we have REST API docs that might help with what you’re needing, as well as some integrations for forms through Zapier and Messenger apps for surveys in our App Store. Another idea is to design a Custom Bot to send when a button is clicked on your website (such as a ‘Contact Us’ button). This can be used like a contact form but in a more engaging format, while also filling in their details.\n\n\nQ211\nHow do I get forms.app to work with Intercom when the form submissions are not coming into the Intercom inbox? The forms.app integration is built by their team, not Intercom. You’ll want to reach out to their team to chat about the issues that you’re running into since they’ll be the experts on how it works.\n\n\nQ212\nHow do I use the Typeform and Intercom integration? The Typeform integration allows you to create forms in Typeform and send them to your Intercom customers in your outbound messages and conversations. This integration is built by the team at Typeform, so specific questions about how it operates, will need to be sent to their team. You can also find more information about the integration in the Intercom App Store.\n\n\nQ213\nHow can I get support for the Typeform integration and other third-party apps? For the Typeform integration and other third-party apps, you should reach out to the team that built the app for appropriate support. You can find the link to their support team within the description of the app itself.\n\n\nQ214\nIs there a phone number to call support? Our team currently doesn’t offer phone support as we find using Intercom to communicate very effective for sharing links, articles, and screenshots. As an online support company, we believe that we can get you the best answers with the most information right here over the chat. We do offer scheduled video calls as part of our Premier Support add-on. If that’s something you’re interested in upgrading to, let us know and we can loop in our Sales team! Otherwise, if you need help with a specific issue, feel free to provide more information and we’ll be happy to assist you here.\n\n\nQ215\nWhat should I do if I am experiencing major technical difficulties with your website and is there a way to get phone support? If you are experiencing major technical difficulties with our website, try the following troubleshooting steps: 1. Perform a hard refresh of your browser. 2. Log into the website in an incognito browser and see if the issue persists. 3. Log into the website on a different web browser and see if the issue persists. 4. Clear your cache and cookies using the Application pane in your browser’s Developer Tools. As for phone support, our team currently doesn’t offer it, but we do offer scheduled video calls as part of our Premier Support add-on. If you’re interested in upgrading, let us know and we can loop in our Sales team.\n\n\nQ216\nWhat should I do if users cannot access the platform, and how can I involve them in a support conversation? If users cannot access the platform, have them try the following steps: perform a hard refresh, test in an incognito browser, test a different browser, and test an alternative wifi network or personal hotspot on a mobile phone. If the issue persists, gather information about their browser, OS, and any console errors. Check for console errors by accessing the browser’s Console (Command-Option-J on Mac or Ctrl-Shift-J on Windows). Clear the console, replicate the issue, and take a screenshot of any errors that appear in red.

Try these options and let us know if the issue persists.\n\n\nQ224\nWhy are tickets taking so long to load up when I’m trying to switch from one to another, and what can I do to fix it? Tickets taking a long time to load might be caused by local issues. To fix this, try clearing your cache and cookies, using an incognito window, or trying a different device or network. If the issue persists, contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ225\nHow can I resolve the UI getting heavy and laggy when dealing with a large number of tickets? Lag can be caused by various factors, such as browser, system, or network-related delays. Try testing in a private browser to see if the issue persists. To investigate further, provide a screenshot of the console and a recording of the issue. You can open the Console by right-clicking the page, choosing Inspect, and then clicking into the Console tab.\n\n\nQ226\nHow can I find out how much time each agent spends per ticket? You can find this information in the Customer Support Reporting tab. There, you can access various metrics such as First response time, Time to close, Conversation Handling Time, Teammate Handling Time, Response time, and First assignment to close time.\n\n\nQ227\nHow can I track the amount of time spent per email and ticket by agent? You can use the Responsiveness report in Intercom to track the amount of time spent per email and ticket by agent. The Time to Close metric in the report tells you how quickly your teammates close conversations and resolve your customers’ issues. It is the median duration of any inbound or outbound conversation begun during a specific period, calculated from the date of the first customer message or reply to the date it was last closed.\n\n\nQ228\nHow can I track the amount of time an agent spends on each ticket they are responding to? Time to close in your Responsiveness report tells you how quickly your teammates close conversations and resolve your customers’ issues. Time to Close is the median duration of any inbound or outbound conversation begun during this period.\n\n\nQ229\nHow can I export all agents’ response time and handle time? You can export the Teammate performance report, which includes statistics such as response time and handling time for all agents.\n\n\nQ230\nHow can I correctly count tickets with an agent touch and measure support productivity? To correctly count tickets with an agent touch and measure support productivity, you can review the amount of unique conversations a teammate replied to from your Teammate Performance Report. Apply the Team filter to the top and the Teammate performance chart in that report will populate with metrics for the individual during that date range. Note that the date range is pulling conversations based on start date, not the dates the conversation is occurring.\n\n\nQ231\nHow can I correctly count tickets with an agent touch and measure support productivity? You can review the amount of unique conversations a teammate replied to from your Teammate Performance Report. Apply the Team filter to the top and the Teammate performance chart in that report will populate with metrics for the individual during that date range. Note that the date range is pulling conversations based on start date, not the dates the conversation is occurring.\n\n\nQ232\nCan you provide data on the effectiveness of using tickets to optimize chats with clients and monitor metrics such as customer satisfaction? You can find customer stories on our website that show data using tickets and bots from companies like yours. These stories can provide insights into the effectiveness of using tickets for optimizing chats and monitoring metrics.\n\n\nQ233\nHow do your tickets work, and is it possible to communicate with the customer through the ticket itself? Tickets primarily serve as a way to leave internal notes. While it is not possible to chat with the customer directly through the ticket, ticket status changes can be automatically communicated with the customer. Depending on how you create a ticket, you can have a conversation with the customer and also have a linked ticket next to it, allowing you to see any updates in internal notes. Communication with the customer is limited to sending ticket status changes.\n\n\nQ234\nIs there any way to send a customer the ticket and have them fill it out when you’re in the middle of a conversation with them? Currently, there is no way to manually send a ticket to a customer to fill out during a conversation. The only way to create this type of flow would be using a custom bot to collect data from the customer and then create a ticket, though this wouldn’t be possible to manually trigger during a conversation.\n\n\nQ235\nHow can users create a ticket from the Messenger? There are two ways that users can create a ticket from the Messenger: 1) Custom Bot: You can end a Custom Bot Pathway with a Ticket Creation step and choose what Ticket Type to send for the user to fill out. When they fill it out, the conversation will be converted to a Ticket. 2) Resolution Bot: You can create an action in your Resolution Bot Behaviors to ask the user to create a Ticket in the Handover section when Resolution Bot cannot answer their question or they ask to talk to a teammate.\n\n\nQ236\nHow can I create and share custom ticket types with customers? To create and share custom ticket types with customers, follow these steps:. Go to Settings &gt; Workspace data &gt; Ticket types and click + Create ticket type.. Once you add the ticket type, create the ‘attribute’ for this ticket.. Set the attribute visibility so the customer can see it.doing this, you can create custom ticket types that can be shared with customers, unlike the default ticket types which are only visible to teammates in the Inbox.\n\n\nQ237\nHow can I share tickets with customers and make them visible when the default setting is not visible to customers? The default ticket types cannot be shared with customers and will only be visible to teammates in the Inbox. Customers will not be notified about activity that happens on the ticket. To share tickets with customers and make them visible, you can create a custom ticket type and set the attribute visibility so the customer can see it. When creating a custom ticket type, ensure that you set the attribute visibility so the customer can see it. If the ticket is still not visible to customers, contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ238\nHow can I share a customer ticket or conversation with my teammates? You can share the full URL that’s in your browser bar to link your team to the ticket or conversation in Intercom. If those folks have Intercom access, and access to that conversation in Intercom, it should allow them to view the conversation in full.\n\n\nQ239\nHow can I find and view my open tickets in Intercom? If the tickets you have created were reassigned or are automatically assigned to other teams, they won’t show in your inbox anymore. You can use Inbox Views to show specific ticket types or tickets with a specific status.\n\n\nQ240\nWhat should I do if many tickets and users are missing in my Intercom account, and can I undo bulk deletes of users and associated conversations? Check if anyone in your workspace recently bulk archived any profiles, as archiving users also deletes their conversations. If you’re still unsure, contact Intercom support for further investigation. Intercom support can help you undo bulk deletes within a specific time range, which will restore the deleted users and their associated conversations.\n\n\nQ241\nHow can I unarchive a user or lead in Intercom? It’s not possible to restore an archived user/lead from within the UI, however there are a few other ways to restore users and leads. This includes: 1: If the user/lead returns to your site/login again 2: Adding the user/lead manually with a CSV import. Once restored, the user or lead’s Intercom profile will be restored with all data and conversations details.\n\n\nQ242\nHow can I unarchive a user or lead in Intercom? It’s not possible to restore an archived user/lead from within the UI, however there are a few other ways to restore users and leads. This includes: 1: If the user/lead returns to your site/login again 2: Adding the user/lead manually with a CSV import. Once restored, the user or lead’s Intercom profile will be restored with all data and conversations details.\n\n\nQ243\nHow can I remove a user from a company profile in Intercom when they no longer work with the company? If a certain customer is no longer associated with a specific company, you can remove them from that company in Intercom in two ways: 1. Manually, by going to your Companies page and removing the specific users. 2. Using the API to detach users from a company.\n\n\nQ244\nWhy does a user with a specific email address have no company details on their Intercom page, including company ID? A user may not have company details on their Intercom page, including company ID, because they are not associated with a company. Companies can be created and updated via Intercom’s JavaScript API and REST API.\n\n\nQ245\nWhy is the company created field showing Unknown? The company created field is populated on your side. If you pass that value, it will be populated, but if you don’t, it will appear as unknown. You’ll need to send it to Intercom via the JavaScript snippet, the API, or an app from our app store.\n\n\nQ246\nHow is the company created field populated in Intercom and how can I find out when a company was created? The company created field is populated on your side, so if you pass that value then it will be populated, but if you don’t populate it then it will appear as unknown. You’ll need to send it to Intercom via the JavaScript snippet, the API, or an app from our app store. The Company ’created_at\n\n\nQ247\nWhat is the Signed Up date attribute in Intercom and how does it work? The Signed Up date attribute is an Intercom specific field that indicates the time a user signed up for your service. It should be sent to Intercom through your integration, either by sending the created_at parameter timestamp in the intercomSettings snippet, setting the value for signed_up_at if you’re using the REST API, or using a CSV import. The Signed Up date attribute does not update periodically and is set when the user first joins your website or app. Intercom will automatically set the value for the signed_up date in certain cases, such as SDKs (Android/iOS) and unidentified users, or users created through the JS snippet with no created_at value. In all other cases, the value would have to be set by you.\n\n\nQ248\nHow can I add and manage custom user attributes in Intercom? To create a new attribute in Intercom, go to Settings &gt; Your workspace data &gt; People data and click \"+ Create attribute\". Then, determine a name, description, and data type that the attribute will store. To populate the attribute for any of your customers, you can send the attribute to Intercom via the JavaScript snippet, CSV import, Intercom’s REST API, or a third party application. To prevent the custom attribute from being updated through the Messenger, select the option in the attribute settings. Any request to update this attribute from the Messenger on web, mobile, or via the Javascript API will be silently ignored. This setting can be toggled on or off by updating the attribute and it does not affect updates\n\n\nQ249\nWhat’s the difference between Attribute and User data in Intercom, and how can I integrate Intercom with other tools? Intercom stores three types of data about your users: 1. Standard Data Attributes — the default set of data we already have about your users, 2. Custom Attributes — the data you send us about your users, and 3. Events — the data that records specific actions that users take in your app. To integrate Intercom with other tools, you can use the Intercom App Store, which offers various apps for integration with tools such as Slack, Salesforce, HubSpot, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Connecting Intercom to other tools can help your team access all of the information they need directly from the inbox and help your customers access critical information via your Messenger.\n\n\nQ250\nHow can I sync customer activity data and user activity details between Intercom and Salesforce? Intercom’s Salesforce app supports two types of data attribute syncing: Event-based sync and Manual Bulk sync. Both types of sync rely on the attribute mappings configured in the app settings. The core integration for Salesforce will be able to pass user activity details, like what emails or notifications they received from Intercom, to be reflected within the Activity details of that user in Salesforce. You can set up the integration to sync user activity details between Intercom and Salesforce.\n\n\nQ251\nHow does Intercom know the correct User in Salesforce to refer to when syncing Contacts? Contacts are mapped between Intercom and Salesforce based on a shared identifier (either email address or an id).\n\n\nQ252\nWhat happens when I start a manual bulk sync between Salesforce and Intercom? The manual bulk sync will only sync the mapped attributes for Intercom leads/users that are currently mapped to Salesforce leads/contacts, but are not currently matching. It will not create any new contacts/records, only update non-matching mapped attributes.\n\n\nQ253\nWhy are account attributes from Salesforce not syncing with Intercom when there is no existing company in Intercom? Account attributes from Salesforce will only sync with Intercom when there is an existing company/account in both platforms that have a valid identity mapping, i.e., both IDs match in either platform. It will not sync if there is no existing mapping, like in cases where there is no company present in Intercom.\n\n\nQ254\nHow can I update user and company data via intercomSettings in the browser? You need to pass the information to Intercom with the User in a company object to update it. You can read more about grouping your users by company here.\n\n\nQ255\nHow can I bulk update Intercom data and contacts with the API? Currently, there is no bulk contact update API available. You can use the REST API to update users and custom user attributes individually, but there is no endpoint for updating multiple contacts at once.\n\n\nQ256\nHow can I automatically load new users from my app into Intercom? To automate the creation of new users in Intercom, your development team can either create the users via the JavaScript API or the REST API. For the JavaScript API, booting the messenger with an email address or user_id that does not match an existing record will effectively create a new user record. For the REST API, your team can create a new user anytime by sending a request to the Create Contact API endpoint.\n\n\nQ257\nWhat is the best practice in Intercom to segment users signing up for info to get in-app messages pushed to them? To segment users who recently signed up so that you can send outbound messages to them, you can use a predefined segment of \"new\" customers, which includes any new users who signed up less than 1 day ago.\n\n\nQ260\nHow can I block spam on Intercom? To block a user who is sending spam, you can use the […] menu next to their name in the righthand sidebar.\n\n\nQ261\nHow does Intercom handle spam filtering and blocking/unblocking users? Intercom has a built-in spam filter that automatically assigns scores to inbound emails and filters out anything considered \"spammy.\" To check for any messages that may have been incorrectly filtered, go to your Inbox, check the Spam folder, and\n\n\nQ262\nHow can I deal with suspicious messages from customers and how does Intercom’s spam filter work? If you receive a suspicious message from a customer, close the message as spam and block the user. To block the user, select the dropdown from the top right corner of their user profile and select \"Block\". If you block someone by mistake, you can unblock them in Settings &gt; General &gt; Blocked People. Intercom’s spam filter automatically filters spam email messages out of your inbox. It works by reading the \"spamminess\" of an inbound message, based on various checks, mostly related to authentication. If the message scores too high on spam probability, it won’t be delivered to your Inbox.\n\n\nQ263\nHow does spam filtering work in the Inbox and how can I prevent spam from reaching it? The Inbox has built-in spam filtering and will filter anything that we consider \"spammy\", checking for hidden links, malware and phishing, as well as checking that the sender’s address is properly authenticated. These messages are automatically stored in a folder within the Inbox. If you notice some messages in the folder that are genuine and not spam, click the \"Not Spam\" button. This will send the message back to the Inbox and help train our algorithm for future. To prevent spam from reaching the Inbox, you could set up Inbox automation rules to catch spam and close the conversations.\n\n\nQ264\nHow can I manually mark an email as spam and what are some options to prevent spam from making it to the Inbox? The Inbox has built-in spam filtering and will filter anything that we consider \"spammy\", checking for hidden links, malware and phishing, as well as checking that the sender’s address is properly authenticated. If you notice some messages in the folder that are genuine and not spam, click the \"Not Spam\" button. This will send the message back to the Inbox and help train our algorithm for future. To prevent spam from making it to the Inbox, you could set up some Inbox automation to catch spam and close the conversations, for example a rule like this could work. Additionally, marking genuine messages as \"Not Spam\" will help train the algorithm for future.\n\n\nQ265\nHow can I prevent genuine emails from going to the spam folder? The Inbox has built-in spam filtering and will filter anything that it considers \"spammy\". However, it is possible for the spam filter to catch a few genuine emails. To view messages that have been flagged as spam or add the spam folder to your main Inbox view, click on \"Edit\" in the Inbox, then click the \"+\" sign next to \"Spam\" and click \"Done\" to save this view. If you notice some messages in the folder that are genuine and not spam, click the \"Not Spam\" button.\n\n\nQ266\nCan we delete messages from the Spam folder? At the moment, there’s not a way to manually delete conversations in your spam folder. They will clear out automatically after 30 days. If the spam is coming from a particular user, you have the option to block them. This will archive everything about the user including their messages as well as blocking them from being recreated again (unless you unblock them).\n\n\nQ267\nHow can I delete a conversation after it’s completed? To delete a conversation, you need to delete the lead or user associated with the conversation. You can archive users or leads directly from your Contacts list, which acts as a soft delete. If the person returns, all data, including associated conversations, will be restored. To permanently remove all data associated with a user or lead, go to Settings &gt; [Workspace name] Data &gt; Deleting people data to delete them individually or use the REST API to delete users in bulk.\n\n\nQ268\nHow can I delete a chat completely, if I don’t want it to count on volume or customer satisfaction? There is no direct way to permanently delete a conversation. However, if you archive or permanently delete a user or lead, all data associated with them, including conversations, will be archived or deleted. You can archive users or leads from your Contacts list, and to permanently remove all data associated with a user or lead, go to Settings &gt; [Workspace name] Data &gt; Deleting people data to delete them individually or use the REST API to delete users in bulk.\n\n\nQ269\nHow can I manage and understand the impact of limiting user conversations on response times, volume, and reports? You can control inbound conversation volume and prevent duplicate conversations by using the Prevent multiple inbound conversations setting. This can be found in your Messenger Settings and targeted to only apply to visitors or users who match certain data criteria. Limiting users to one conversation shouldn’t alter your volume report negatively, as this will be a more accurate representation of your inbound channel volume, especially if you are having continuous problems with duplicate conversations.\n\n\nQ270\nHow can I check which types of chats are affecting my response times the most? There are two ways you could do this: 1) CSV Export: You can do an export of your conversations under Reports &gt; Customer support &gt; Export. You can choose to filter all conversations or only conversations assigned to yourself. Once you have the export, you can filter the Time to first reply column by descending and see which conversations have the longest reply time. 2) Custom Report: If you want to have a dashboard displaying this information, you could create a Custom Report. If you wanted to deep dive into the days/weeks with longer response times, you can export the conversations from the chart and filter the export like you would in solution 1.\n\n\nQ271\nHow can I find a report with the longest chat? You can use the Customer Support Reporting tab to review various support metrics. The \"time to close\" metric might be the most relevant for finding the longest chat.\n\n\nQ272\nHow can I see which pages in my product the users are initiating conversations? You can see what page a user is on when they start a conversation in the conversation itself. For a report, under Reports &gt; Overview, you can look at \"Top pages for new inbound conversations.\" However, there isn’t a report for all conversations. A workaround may be to add a custom attribute to identify the user’s source and use this attribute to filter Reports.\n\n\nQ273\nHow to separate conversations based on Leads and Existing clients where Channel = Chat? Currently, there isn’t a way to get a list of all conversations started by leads/visitors and users in one place. You would need to click into each profile to view all conversations associated with them.\n\n\nQ274\nHow can I implement a custom bot to manage conversations only for users and not leads, and what trigger should I use? To implement a custom bot to manage conversations only for users and not leads, set the audience to \"Users\" when creating the Custom Bot.\n\n\nQ275\nHow do I create and set up a custom bot to appear whenever a client is starting a conversation with us? To create a custom bot that triggers when a user starts a new conversation, go to the operator tab and create a new custom bot from there. Make sure you’re not creating the custom bot from the outbound section, as it cannot fulfill an inbound custom bot’s duties. Once created, ensure that the Custom Bot starts from new conversations and that the customer matches its filters. When this is the case, predictive answers will not be shown, and the Custom Bot’s first message and reply buttons will be displayed for the user to choose from.\n\n\nQ276\nHow do I make sure my Custom Bot is what customers meet in the Compact Messenger, instead of the Resolution Bot? Use the Custom Bot with the setting \"Customer opens a new conversation in the Messenger\" to ensure that the Custom Bot is the first bot they interact with before anything is typed in the Messenger.\n\n\nQ278\nWhat triggers Resolution Bot answers and where do they come from? Resolution Bot answers are triggered when a customer asks a question that matches one of the trained Custom Answers. They are created and managed in the Automation section of the Intercom platform.\n\n\nQ279\nHow is the automated resolution rate calculated? The automated resolution rate is calculated by taking the number of conversations closed by Resolution Bot and dividing it by the number of “Seeking support sessions” where Resolution Bot delivered an answer. This does not include conversations that were dropped off or ended with a human.\n\n\nQ280\nHow is the median time to close a conversation calculated when using custom bots? Does the calculation start from the moment the user starts interacting with the bot, from the moment they send the first message, or from the moment we send our first reply? The Time to close is calculated as the time between the conversation’s first message from a user (when it was started) and when it was last closed.\n\n\nQ281\nWhy doesn’t a teammate have a median response time? The reason why the teammate’s \"Median response time\" is empty is because all the conversations they responded to within that timeframe were started and responded to outside office hours. The workspace is configured to calculate durations in reporting only within office hours.\n\n\nQ282\nAre bot replies included in the \"Conversations replied to\" metric in Intercom reports? In Intercom reports, the \"conversations replied to\" metric specifically refers to conversations where a teammate replied. This means that conversations where only Custom Bots or Resolution Bot replied are not included in this metric.\n\n\nQ283\nHow are ‘First contact’ and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) percentage defined in Intercom’s reports, and how can I export my reporting data? First contact’ in Intercom’s Effectiveness report is defined as a conversation that meets all of the following conditions: Is currently closed, has only been closed once, was closed by a teammate (not a bot), contains at least one visible teammate reply, and was only replied to by a single teammate. The Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) percentage is calculated as the sum of 4-r\n\n\nQ284\nHow to activate the customer satisfaction survey on Intercom? You can enable the Customer Satisfaction survey from Operator &gt; Task bots &gt; When a conversation is closed. You will need to enable this for Users and Leads separately.\n\n\nQ285\nCan Intercom help a small consulting firm? Yes, Intercom can help a small consulting firm by providing customer intelligence, onboarding and retaining users, live chat, and customer support at scale. It is suitable for product teams, marketing teams, support teams, and customer success teams, making it easy to personally communicate with users through targeted, behavior-driven email and in-app messages.\n\n\nQ286\nIs onboarding a capability that Intercom offers? Yes, Intercom offers onboarding capabilities. You can send a series of personalized email, in-app, and push messages to introduce customers to your product and get them to that ‘aha’ moment.\n\n\nQ287\nHow can I access the app tour functionality in Intercom? To access the Quick Start Guide, click on the Intercom icon in the top left corner when viewing your Intercom workspace.\n\n\nQ288\nHow can I create bookmarks or shortcuts in Intercom to quickly access different sections? Currently, it’s not possible to create bookmarks within the Intercom interface. However, you can create bookmarks in your browser to a specific section of Intercom.\n\n\nQ289\nIs there any way to disable or customize the shortcuts in Intercom? It currently isn’t possible to disable or customize the shortcuts in Intercom. The new inbox is centered around a keyboard-first approach that uses shortcuts to increase efficiency. However, adjustments have been made to some previous shortcuts and keystrokes to reduce errors.\n\n\nQ290\nHow can I disable or change the hotkeys in Intercom? Currently, it isn’t possible to disable or customize the shortcuts in Intercom. You can access the Keyboard Shortcuts at any time by hitting Command & K (mac) or Control & K (windows) to open the menu. You can also click the lightning bolt icon to access the menu.\n\n\nQ291\nHow can I switch to dark mode in Intercom? To switch between dark and light theme, go to a conversation in the Inbox and click the lightning bolt ⚡in the composer to open the menu (or use the keyboard shortcut ⌘K for Mac or Ctrl+K for Windows) and type in \"dark\" or \"light\", and select \"switch to dark\\light theme\". Note: Dark mode is only available in the Inbox and not in other parts of Intercom.\n\n\nQ292\nHow do I switch between dark and light theme in Intercom? To switch between dark and light theme in Intercom, go to a conversation in the Inbox and click the lightning bolt in the composer to open the menu (or use the keyboard shortcut ⌘K for Mac or Ctrl+K for Windows) and type in \"dark\" or \"light\", and select \"switch to dark\\light theme\". Note: Dark mode is only available in the Inbox and not in other parts of the platform.\n\n\nQ293\nHow do I set up email templates in Intercom? To set up email templates, go to Outbound &gt; Settings &gt; Email Templates, where you’ll have an opportunity to choose a default template to be used when composing a new message, as well as a space to create custom templates. You can use custom hosted web fonts from an open source font service like Google Fonts. However, if your email client doesn’t support this, the text in your emails will fallback to use your websafe font. If you’re using Google Fonts, you’ll need to use the ‘@import’ method to embed the stylesheet in Intercom.\n\n\nQ294\nHow can I customize email templates using Intercom’s API? When using Intercom API to send email messages, the only two templates available are \"Plain\" or \"Personal\", and these are predefined and not able to be customized at this time.\n\n\nQ295\nHow do I add pre-header text to the emails in Intercom? Setting or customizing pre-header text for Intercom emails is not currently supported within the Intercom platform.\n\n\nQ296\nHow can I customize the appearance of outgoing messages and stay updated on new features? Currently, it is not possible to change the font or text style of outgoing messages. However, you can submit a feature request for the product team to consider. To stay updated on new features, you can visit the Product Changes page at https://www.intercom.com/changes/en.\n\n\nQ297\nHow can I customize the text and styling in Intercom banners, posts, and email templates? For banners and posts, it’s currently not possible to change the font or size of the text, but you can format the text to bold/italics, add headers, links, and more. The color of buttons and links can be configured in Messenger settings as action color. More styling tools might be added in the future.\n\n\nQ298\nHow can I customize the color and size of an article header in Intercom? Currently, there is no way to customize the color and size of a header in an article. You can change text size by switching to an H2 or H3, but the size and color are predefined.\n\n\nQ299\nHow can I customize and import articles in Intercom? You can format your articles using the Articles API, and supported HTML and CSS can be found in the Intercom API documentation. However, custom CSS and unsupported tags are not allowed, as Intercom Articles do not support custom styling or custom tags. Unsupported tags and styles will be removed from your article. To import HTML articles, you can use the Create an Article endpoint of the REST API, where the \"body\" in the article object of the request would expect the content to be in HTML format. Note that importing HTML files directly through the workspace UI is not supported.\n\n\nQ300\nHow can I import articles from Document360 into Intercom, and what is the workflow for doing so? To import articles from Document360 into Intercom, you would need to create an app in Intercom’s Developer Hub to use the REST API for creating new articles. The workflow for importing articles is as follows: 1. Retrieve article(s) from Document360 using their REST API. 2. Parse the relevant information from the API response. 3. Perform any necessary HTML conversions to ensure that the content only uses HTML supported by Intercom. 4. Make an API request to Intercom to create an article. This process would require developer input on your end.\n\n\nQ301\nHow can I import articles? Currently, we only support importing articles from Zendesk to Intercom. If you want to use other importers, you can use the Articles API to import from other tools. To import from Zendesk, click \"Import\" on the articles page, paste the URL of your Zendesk Help Center, and follow the prompts. Once the import is complete, refresh the page to view the new article collection and enable your help center.\n\n\nQ302\nHow can I export articles from Intercom Help Center? You can export articles from your Help Center by using the Articles API. Although there isn’t a direct download option within Intercom, you can find full details on how to use the Articles API in our developer documentation.\n\n\nQ303\nHow can I export a list of all the articles on Intercom? You can export Articles from your Help Center by using the Articles API. Full details on how to do this can be found in the developer documentation.\n\n\nQ304\nHow can I export my articles to migrate to another Intercom account? There isn’t a way to migrate data from one workspace to another directly, but you can export and import Articles from the Help Centers by using the Articles API. If you’re able to export your current help center into a suitable format, you can also use our REST API Articles endpoint to create Articles in the new workspace.\n\n\nQ305\nHow can I transfer Help Center articles from one workspace to another without doing it manually one by one? To transfer your articles from one Help Center to another, you can make use of our REST API. The recommended flow is to: 1. List all articles using the API. 2. For each article, create that article again in the new workspace using the API. Alternatively, you could potentially use an article importer tool, but it may not be supported by us.\n\n\nQ306\nCan all articles of the Help Centre be exported and in which format? You are able to export Articles from your Help Center by using the Articles API. Full details on how to do this can be found in our dev docs and in the guide.\n\n\nQ307\nHow can I export a csv of all help articles? You can export Articles from your Help Center by using the Articles API. Full details on how to do this can be found in the developer documentation.\n\n\nQ308\nHow can I export all articles to csv? You can export Articles from your Help Center by using the Articles API. Full details on how to do this can be found in the developer documentation and related guides.\n\n\nQ309\nHow can I export all my articles? You can export Articles from your Help Center by using the Articles API. Full details on how to do this can be found in the developer documentation.\n\n\nQ310\nHow can I export my Articles in bulk? You can export Articles from your Help Center in bulk by using the Articles API. Full details on how to do this can be found in the developer documentation.\n\n\nQ311\nHow can I export a list of all articles and article IDs? You can retrieve all articles and their IDs through our REST API, but not in the UI. Exporting it with the REST API will require you to parse some JSON data. You’ll want to use the \"Retrieve all Articles\" endpoint.\n\n\nQ312\nWhat are the features of Articles Pro? Articles Pro includes audience targeting (allowing articles behind a login), multilingual collections.\n\n\nQ313\nIs audience targeting in articles available on my plan? Audience targeting is available on the Support Pro plan. To use it, you need to have the Messenger in your product for logged-in users, a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled, and configure a login link in your Help Center settings under \"Privacy.\"\n\n\nQ314\nHow can I target an article to a specific audience? To target an article to a specific audience, you need to use the Messenger in your product for logged-in users and have a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled. This setup allows distinguishing between logged-in users and visitors or leads. After setting this up, enable Audience Targeting within your Help Center settings &gt; \"Privacy\" by configuring a login link that encourages people to log in when they’ve attempted to view an article available only for Users.\n\n\nQ315\nHow do I enable audience targeting on articles and what are the requirements? To enable audience targeting on articles, you must have a link to a login page so that if a logged-out user tries to access an article with audience targeting, they can log in and it will then be accessible to them. This setting can be found under the Privacy tab. Additionally, enabling audience targeting on your articles requires having a custom domain setup.\n\n\nQ316\nHow can I manage the availability and visibility of knowledge base articles for specific audiences? You can manage the availability and visibility of knowledge base articles for specific audiences by using audience targeting. To use audience targeting, you need to have the Messenger in your product for logged-in users and a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled. After setting this up, enable Audience Targeting within your Help Center settings under \"Privacy\" and configure a login link. This will allow you to target your articles to specific audience criteria and restrict their visibility in search results.\n\n\nQ317\nHow can I set up multiple versions of an AI bot with different access to articles based on user groups and audience rules? You can set up multiple versions of the AI bot using audience targeting. The bot answers questions based on the articles that the end-user on Messenger has access to see. It won’t answer questions using private or restricted articles that an end-user has no access to. To limit which articles the AI bot is basing its answers on depending on which group of users the person falls into, you can set audience targeting for articles as well. This feature may require a higher subscription and proper setup, including using the Messenger for logged-in users, having a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled, and enabling Audience Targeting within your Help Center settings.\n\n\nQ318\nHow can I control article suggestions in Messenger and custom bots? You can do this by going to Task bots &gt; Suggest help articles. This will allow you to control the article suggestions in your Messenger.\n\n\nQ319\nHow can I fix the issue of the article suggestion bot showing irrelevant articles to customers? The suggested articles shown are your three most viewed articles. However, you can configure excluded articles from your Messenger settings, taking them out of the rotation. This way, you can decide which articles can be suggested or not.\n\n\nQ320\nHow can I change the \"search articles\" that appear in my Messenger? The \"Suggested articles\" are the top 3 viewed articles in the last 7 days for a given user role (user/visitor). You cannot define which ones appear there.\n\n\nQ321\nHow can I have different suggestions based on which page the user is on in my website? To have different suggestions based on the user’s current page, you’ll need to set up audience targeting. First, ensure you’re using the Messenger in your product for logged-in users and have a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled. This will help differentiate between logged-in users and visitors or leads. Next, enable Audience Targeting within your Help Center settings &gt; \"Privacy\" by configuring a login link that encourages people to log in when attempting to view user-only articles. Once set up, you can target your articles to specific audience criteria based on the user’s current page.\n\n\nQ322\nHow can I feature an article on the Home of the Messenger? To feature an article on the Home of the Messenger, follow these steps: 1. Go to the settings for the apps you want to display on Messenger’s Home. 2. Select to add an additional app. 3. Choose Article Inserter. 4. Pick one article that will always be at Home. Note that you can arrange the app order in the list so the article will always be seen first.\n\n\nQ323\nHow can I open a collection in the messenger and why is it useful? Currently, there is no feature to directly open a collection in the messenger like articles. A workaround for the moment would be to add the Collection as an external link. Opening a collection in the messenger can be useful because it allows you to store articles per section of UI, and the articles in them might be different based on custom attributes. This makes linking the collection stable and hassle-free to maintain, providing a more immersive experience.\n\n\nQ325\nHow do I set up and troubleshoot articles in the Help Center? To troubleshoot issues with your articles, make sure that your article is published and part of a collection. If the issue persists, check your Help Center settings and ensure that your Help Center is set to be published. Turn it on and save the settings.\n\n\nQ326\nHow can I create articles and set up a Help Center, and what should I do if I encounter issues? To create articles and set up a Help Center, follow the provided guides and resources. If you encounter issues, try these troubleshooting steps: hard refresh, testing in an incognito browser, testing a different browser, testing an alternative wifi network or personal hotspot, and disabling any browser extensions. If the issue persists, contact customer support.\n\n\nQ327\nWhat should I do if my article isn’t working and what troubleshooting steps can I try? If you’re having issues with your article, try the following troubleshooting steps: - A hard refresh (Command + Shift + R on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows)- Clearing your cache and disabling extensions- Testing in an incognito browser (Command + Shift + N on Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows)- Testing a different browser to the one that you’re using- Testing an alternative wifi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phone\n\n\nQ328\nWhat should I do if I receive an error message when trying to save an article? First, try a hard refresh of your browser (Command-Shift-R on macOS for Chrome/Firefox, Command-Option-R for Safari). If that doesn’t resolve the issue, check for any console errors by right-clicking the page, choosing Inspect, and clicking into the Console tab. Send a screenshot of the whole page, including the Console area, to customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ329\nWhat should I do if my article updates are not saving? First, try a hard refresh of your browser. If that doesn’t resolve the issue, open an incognito browser and see if the issue persists. If it still doesn’t work, check for any errors in your browser’s Console and send a screenshot to customer support.\n\n\nQ330\nWhat should I do if there is an error saving the article when trying to add it to a collection? Try a hard refresh of your browser. If that doesn’t resolve the issue, open an incognito browser and see if the issue persists. If it still doesn’t work, check for any errors in your browser’s Console by right-clicking the page, choosing Inspect, then clicking into the Console tab. Send a screenshot of your whole page, including the Console area, to customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ331\nCan we add a single article to two different collections? Or do we have to clone it so that we can add them to two different collections? At the moment, it’s not possible to have one article in multiple collections. The workaround we suggest is to link to the other relevant articles within the article itself. That can help customers see other relevant resources.\n\n\nQ332\nCan we add a single article to two different collections? Or do we have to clone it so that we can add them to two different collections? At the moment, it’s not possible to have one article in multiple collections. The workaround we suggest is to link to the other relevant articles within the article itself. That can help customers see other relevant resources.\n\n\nQ333\nIs there an option to set up 2 workspaces within 1 Help Center? You can only have one Help Center per workspace. In order to have a second Help Center, you would need to have another workspace with its own subscription. You can consider using audience targeting to have only certain articles available for certain people if the branding can be the same.\n\n\nQ334\nHow can I create multiple workspaces for different apps and have separate knowledge bases for each app? To create a new workspace, click on your avatar in the lower left-hand corner, hover over your current workspace’s name, and a pop-out should appear. At the bottom of the \"Search for a workspace\" pop-out, click \"Add a new workspace.\" You can only have one Help Center per workspace. If you want to have separate Help Centers for each app, you would need to create different workspaces for each Help Center.\n\n\nQ335\nHow can I manage multiple help centers and improve search and discovery for different product versions? To manage multiple help centers, you would either need to set up multiple workspaces with their own accounts and subscriptions, or you could use a single Help Center with multiple collections. To improve search and discovery for different product versions, you can use audience targeting with your people data, so that customers who are on one version or another only see certain collections or articles. Additionally, you can add tags to your articles to help categorize and view them internally by version, or add callouts to the beginning of articles on one version that help redirect customers to the same article for another version.\n\n\nQ336\nHow can I adjust the target audience for the help center? If an article is published in a collection, it’s visible to everyone by default. However, if you want to define exactly who should be able to view it, you will need to click Edit settings within each article. Then, select if you want to target Visitors, Leads, or Users, or a combination of the three. You can also create a specific audience by clicking on the + Add audience rule button.\n\n\nQ337\nHow can I publish an article but not have it visible in the help center? Once an article is published, it will be visible in your Help Center. You can set up Audience targeting to be visible to yourself (or whomever) only. In order for Audience Targeting to function appropriately, you will need to be using the Messenger in your product for logged in users, as well as having a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled.\n\n\nQ338\nHow can I create a private article in the Help Center that is only accessible with the article URL and doesn’t require a login? To create a private article in the Help Center, simply create and publish the article without adding it to a collection. This will make the article published but not searchable in your Help Center, allowing only those with the direct URL to access it without requiring a login.\n\n\nQ339\nHow can I make my entire help center private and only visible to logged-in users? To make your entire help center private and visible only to logged-in users, follow these steps:. Set the Target audience to only include users that are logged in and not visitors who aren’t logged in.. Ensure you are using the Messenger in your product for logged-in users.. Set up a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled to differentiate between logged-in users and visitors or leads.. Enable Audience Targeting within your Help Center settings under \"Privacy.\". Configure a login link to encourage people to log in when they attempt to view an article that is only available for Users.. Target your articles to specific audience criteria based on your preferences.following these steps, you can make your help center private and accessible only to logged-in users.\n\n\nQ340\nHow can I restrict access to the Intercom Learning Center so that only our members can access it? To restrict access to the Learning Center, you need to use the Messenger in your product for logged-in users and have a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled. After setting this up, you can enable Audience Targeting within your Help Center settings under \"Privacy\" by configuring a login link. This will encourage people to log in when they’ve attempted to view an article that is only available for Users.\n\n\nQ341\nHow can I exclude certain users or users with specific names from being included in my Intercom user database? Unfortunately, it’s not possible to restrict certain users from being created or exclude users with specific names unless you hide the Messenger on your website for these users. This way, the users wouldn’t be able to start a conversation and therefore wouldn’t be created in Intercom. You can hide the Messenger for specific countries or conditions by adding a display rule to the Messenger or adjusting the login snippet.\n\n\nQ342\nHow can I find the number of blocked users and view the list of blocked people in Intercom? Intercom doesn’t provide a direct number of blocked users. However, you can go to the Blocked Users page by navigating to your app settings and selecting Blocked people from the left-hand menu under the General section. You’ll see a list of your blocked users. To find the total number of blocked users, load all the users on the Blocked Users page, and copy-paste them into a spreadsheet to count the rows.\n\n\nQ343\nHow can I troubleshoot errors when using Task bots and third-party apps in Intercom? To troubleshoot errors with Task bots, try the following steps: hard refresh, testing in an incognito browser, testing on a different browser, testing an alternative wifi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phone, and disabling any browser extensions. For errors with third-party apps, check the settings of the installed apps in the App Store and make sure they are correct. If the settings look good, check for any errors in your browser’s console when the issue occurs and share the errors with customer support.\n\n\nQ344\nThe API call allocation is showing zero in the Salesforce app The allocation of calls specifically for Intercom is the number that you currently have set in the app. The number of available API calls depends on your subscription with Salesforce, so it is not something that can be increased from Intercom’s end. You would have to reach out to Salesforce for an increase. If you are experiencing API limit issues, reinstalling the Salesforce app on your workspace might fix the problem. Before reinstalling the app, take screenshots of any mapping and settings you currently have as a reference, as the settings of apps typically are not retained.\n\n\nQ345\nIs the Fin AI instance used for Intercom support the same one that will be available for my account? The Fin AI instance used for Intercom support is based on the same technology and is pointed to Intercom’s Help Center. When it becomes available for your workspace, your instance will be equally capable, providing the information it has taken in is accurate.\n\n\nQ346\nIs Intercom HIPAA compliant, and are the AI features within Fin HIPAA compliant? Intercom has successfully completed a HIPAA attestation examination, and we can enter into a business associate agreement with your organization should your business require HIPAA compliance. However, Intercom does not make any representation that the AI features within Fin are HIPAA compliant. We don’t currently have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place with OpenAI, either. We can’t give any guarantees in relation to any ePHI data uploaded to Fin.\n\n\nQ347\nHow can I get a BAA in place with Intercom? If your business is required to be HIPAA compliant, Intercom can enter into a BAA with your organization. However, this will require you to be on a Scale or Premium subscription. Log in to your workspace and contact support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ348\nCan I use Intercom for getting sensitive and secure information from our clients, and is it secure to use a custom bot for this purpose? Intercom is used by various companies that handle sensitive PII, and it is HIPAA compliant. However, you should review Intercom’s security policy and certifications to ensure it meets your specific requirements. This also applies to handling sensitive information through custom bots.\n\n\nQ349\nCan you provide more information about GDPR and data protection? Is Intercom compatible with Magento 2.0? Intercom is invested in aligning with the GDPR and remaining transparent about how we use data. We have implemented product features and processes to allow us to meet our obligations, as well as help our customers to meet theirs. You can read more about how we are GDPR compliant in our documentation. As for Magento 2.0 compatibility, more information is needed to determine compatibility.\n\n\nQ350\nWhere is the data stored and processed in Intercom, and can we choose to have our data processed in the EU? Your data hosting region is currently in the US. You can opt to move to a new regional workspace to have your data processed in the EU when being handled by Intercom. However, there are a few apps and integrations that are not yet available in regional workspaces. The EU data centre is located in Amazon Web Services in the eu-west-1 AWS Region (Dublin, Ireland).\n\n\nQ351\nHow can I find my Intercom data hosting region? You can find your Intercom data hosting region in your workspace URL. For US customers, it is app.intercom.com; for EU customers, it is app.eu.intercom.com; and for Australian customers, it is app.au.intercom.com.\n\n\nQ352\nHow do I find my app’s timezone in Intercom? To find your app’s timezone in Intercom, go to your avatar (bottom left) &gt; settings &gt; General settings. You’ll see the timezone under the name of the workspace.\n\n\nQ353\nWhy can’t customers from Vietnam see the Intercom entrance on my website, and what can I do to resolve this issue? Some Internet Service Providers in Vietnam are not connecting to Intercom, causing connection and latency issues for customers. Unfortunately, this isn’t something that can be fixed on our side, as the problem is due to specific ISP setup. To resolve the Intercom visibility issue in Vietnam, you can implement a workaround by adding the following attribute to the Messenger settings in the Javascript code that is calling the Messenger: api_base: ‘https://[your app ID].intercom-messenger.com’. Replace [your app ID] with your Workspace App ID.\n\n\nQ354\nDo outbound phone calls work only for Canada, UK, and USA? The countries listed are the numbers you can request for your Intercom workspace. We can support 1 phone number per workspace at this time. So, the one phone number you request is limited to either Canada, the UK, or the US. However, you can make outbound phone calls to multiple countries, including US/Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, UK, India, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n\nQ355\nCan I call a number in Egypt using a UK registered number with Intercom’s calling feature? At the moment, registered numbers are only supported in the UK, US, and Canada. More geographies for registering phone numbers and countries to which we allow phone calls will be supported in the future.\n\n\nQ356\nHow can I temporarily disable Intercom on our website and provide an alternative contact method? You can use the inbound conversation volume to disable new conversations and put up a special notice with your email. Additionally, you can turn on ‘prevent replies to closed conversations’ in the same menu and then close the existing conversations.\n\n\nQ357\nHow can I pause or stop all outbound messaging (Series, emails, posts, etc.) in Intercom at the same time for a specific duration? Currently, there is no way to pause all Series or stop all outbound messaging at the same time for a specific duration. Pausing a Series will prevent it from matching new users/leads, but those who had matched when it was still live would still receive the content, like email.\n\n\nQ358\nHow do I make sure people who unsubscribe at any point don’t receive future emails automatically when setting up a series in Intercom? Once a customer is unsubscribed from all emails, they’re not going to receive any emails including those which are parts of the Series. This means they are automatically excluded from future emails. So if a series contains a few messages, let’s say a few in-app messages (like chats and posts), as well as emails, a customer who is unsubscribed from all emails, will be able to enter the series and receive in-app messages, but they won’t receive any emails.\n\n\nQ359\nHow does Intercom handle user online status and series entry? A user \"comes online\" in Intercom when they log in to your app or visit your website and are tracked by Intercom. Entry rules for series are checked once an hour for anyone who should enter, and when a user comes online, they’ll enter any series where they match the entry rules. A user can also enter a series without coming online, as entry rules are checked\n\n\nQ360\nHow do SLA and team routing rules work together in Intercom? When it comes to SLA Inbox Rules, they won’t prevent other rules from firing. The conversation will continue down the list of rules until it gets assigned, then it stops checking rules. If an assignment doesn’t happen, it ends up in the Default Assignment that is shown at the bottom on the Inbox Rules page.\n\n\nQ361\nHow can I add an SLA to unassigned chats and what should I set as the trigger rule for the workflow? To add an SLA to unassigned chats, you can use the Workflows builder and add various conversation actions to your path, including \"Apply SLA.\" This allows you to set an SLA for unassigned chats as part of your workflow. For the trigger rule, you can use Inbox rules and set the rule as \"teammate is operator\" or \"team is none\" to filter for unassigned chats and apply the SLA.\n\n\nQ362\nHow do I edit an existing SLA or add a new one? To add a new SLA, go to your Inbox Rules, choose any rule, choose the action as \"Apply SLA\" and then choose \"Create new SLA\" from the modal. To replace an existing SLA, archive the old one, create a new one, and update your Inbox rules or bots that are applying the SLA to use the new one.\n\n\nQ363\nCan multiple SLAs be applied to a single conversation, and if so, how are they displayed and reported? It’s currently not possible to add multiple SLAs to one conversation.\n\n\nQ364\nHow can I manage multiple chats raised by the same user? It is currently not possible to merge the conversations, but you can use the duplicate detection bot to help you identify those. The Duplicate Detection Task Bot functions to locate any duplicate conversations that are sent in from the same user within the last 10 hours. If the bot detects a duplicate, you’ll see a note left on the conversation. You can read more about the duplicate task bot in the related help article.\n\n\nQ365\nHow can I manage notifications for conversations and handle duplicate conversations? To manage notifications for conversations, you can either subscribe to receive updates about all activity or none. These notification settings can be found in your account settings. There is no option to subscribe only to specific conversations. If you receive duplicate conversations, it might be due to the customer submitting the message twice. If the issue persists and the customer confirms they only clicked once, report the issue to customer support.\n\n\nQ366\nHow can I identify duplicate conversations in the report export? In the conversations export, there’s not any specific fields that might indicate duplicates. However, you might consider sorting or filtering the data by the following fields to identify duplicates more easily: \"Participated (email)\" under Customer Information and \"Topic\" and \"Created at\" under Conversation Information.\n\n\nQ367\nHow can I report one-touch conversations (email, tickets, chats…) in custom reports? You can use the \"Teammate replies to close a conversation\" metric in a custom report. Although you cannot identify the conversations where only 1 reply was present before closing, if you \"export conversations\", you can then view these results in the CSV and apply a filter to the \"Teammate replies\" column to view all conversations where the \"Teammate replies\" are 1.\n\n\nQ368\nIs it possible to build a custom report for a specific bot? We don’t have custom reports for specific bots at this time. However, you can check out the custom bot path analysis that comes with every bot. It will show a percentage spread of how many were sent, the engage and completion rate, and how the end users navigated the bot.\n\n\nQ369\nHow can I analyze bot data and is there a way to check this data via reports? To analyze bot data for a specific bot, you can see Sent, Engaged, and Completed metrics along with their path analysis in each custom bot. Sent refers to the number of times your Custom Bots have been sent to visitors, leads, or users. Engaged refers to the number of Custom Bots where an end user clicked on at least one reply button after seeing the bot message. Completed refers to the number of bots sent where the end user has reached the end of a bot path, or if a teammate joined the conversation.\n\n\nQ370\nHow can I analyze bot data and check the volume of customers going into a specific bot, including using reports? In each custom bot, you can see Sent, Engaged, and Completed metrics along with their path analysis. However, checking data on a specific pathway is not currently possible. To analyze this data via reports, there isn’t a direct way, but you can use a workaround by tagging users that engaged with the bot and those who completed the bot with different tags. Then, you can apply these tags to a segment in your Contacts tab to show the list of users that have one tag (engaged with bot) but not the other (completed bot).\n\n\nQ371\nHow do I export the list of customers that received a specific bot? First, tag all the people with a specific tag using the ‘Tag all’ button under Custom Bot stats. Then, you can export them using that tag.\n\n\nQ372\nHow can I figure out the percentage of users that are not completing a custom bot? One way to find specific users who didn’t complete the bot is to tag all users that engaged with the bot with one tag, and tag all users that completed the bot with a different tag. Then, use the tags to find those users by applying the tags to a segment in your Contacts Tab. This will show the list of users that have one tag (engaged with bot) but not the other (completed bot).\n\n\nQ373\nWhy is my custom bot not engaging with users and could the issue be related to rules matching or the line? There could be several reasons, such as users not matching the audience rules, users not starting conversations during the scheduled hours, or a higher priority bot triggering instead. To investigate further, please provide the URL of the custom bot and an example conversation where the custom bot did not trigger. If there are no issues with the rules and a significant number of users match, the problem could be that users are not starting conversations during the scheduled hours or a higher priority bot is triggering. Check the priority list for your inbound bots.\n\n\nQ374\nHow can I prevent my custom bot from firing multiple times during a continuing conversation and set conditions for when it triggers? You can control the custom bot triggers by adding audience rules. This way, the bot will only trigger if the customer meets the criteria you specify in the Audience section. However, it’s generally recommended to use the \"Customer sends any message\" trigger for setting conversation data or tagging a conversation when specific keywords are mentioned in a customer’s message.\n\n\nQ375\nIs there a way to prevent the custom bot timeout? How can I prompt customers to come back and complete the bot from where they disengaged? Utilize the unresponsive bot as a reminder for customers. However, it ultimately comes down to the customer’s choice whether they choose to continue with the application or not.\n\n\nQ376\nHow do I manage custom bots, including deleting unwanted bots and adding a start over button? To delete unwanted custom bots, click the check mark next to the bot name and then click delete, or open the bot and click ‘Delete’ under More. To add a start over button in a custom bot, click on the path where you want to give customers an option to go back to the beginning of the bot flow. Add a reply option and select the Start over button. This will add a start over button to the list of reply options. The Start Over option will appear at the end of a number of replies and will not show up at the first reply.

They can improve both your and your customers’ support experience.\n\n\nQ379\nHow can I integrate smart article suggestions with custom bots in Intercom? Smart suggestions are not available in custom bots, but you can use Resolution Bot to follow custom bots and add articles to Resolution Bot answers. You can read about path building in Resolution Bot and letting Resolution Bot follow up after custom bots and messages in the provided documentation. However, it’s not possible at the moment to make smart article suggestions a step in the bot flow. Your suggestion has been logged for the product team to review.\n\n\nQ380\nHow can I train the Resolution Bot to suggest articles based on specific topics? While you’re in the process of training your resolution bot, you need to select \"Add an article\" when creating the answer. You can do so in the Resolution Bot settings for answers.\n\n\nQ381\nHow can I add rating options in a resolution bot and why don’t the smileys work after an article is shared with the customer? Currently, adding rating options in a resolution bot is not possible. However, Operator sends conversation ratings at the right time based on certain criteria. The smileys are for the articles engagement report. If you’re not seeing any data in the reports, try removing the ‘Views greater than 10’ filter.\n\n\nQ382\nHow can I enable conversation ratings and fully leverage the features included in my subscription, such as Macros? To enable the CSAT surveys that customers receive following a closed conversation, click into Operator and then scroll to the bottom of the Task Bot page. This can be configured separately for users and leads within their respective tabs, however, please note that updating this setting will apply it to the settings of all teammates within the workspace. To fully leverage features like Macros, you can set up pre-existing support content to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks. Check out this video that shows you how to create Macros, or take the Academy course to learn more about best practices and see some great Macro examples.\n\n\nQ383\nHow do conversation ratings work, and what are the different aspects of conversation ratings? Conversation ratings are sorted by the date the end user left the rating, and it is not possible to attribute the rating to the date the conversation was started. However, you can create a custom report to view your CSAT based on the date the conversation was started rather than the date the rating was left. Sending for direct outbound conversations means that a rating will trigger if the conversation is started via an outbound message initiated by a teammate. Not sending ratings requests for outbound\n\n\nQ384\nWhat are the criteria for a conversation to be rated? A rating appears when a conversation matches the following criteria: 1. The conversation was replied to by a teammate OR a teammate starts a direct outbound conversation OR the conversation was started from a Custom Bot where a teammate also participated. 2. The conversation is over 250 characters (including spaces, and replies from your teammate and customer). 3. The conversation is closed within a week of the last reply. 4. It’s not a group conversation. 5. A rating request hasn’t been already sent in the conversation.\n\n\nQ385\nWhy didn’t the conversation rating appear after I closed a conversation?

The CSAT ratings apply to the last person who sent a message in the conversation. If the other person simply closed the conversation without replying to the customer, the rating will remain with the original team member who sent the last message.\n\n\nQ387\nHow can I rate conversations through SMS and what should I do if the rating sent via SMS doesn’t give an actual rating and just reopens the conversation? Unfortunately, it’s not possible to send a CSAT natively via SMS. The current system may not recognize the rating response and reopen the conversation instead.\n\n\nQ388\nCan we implement CSAT ratings on tickets as we do in conversations? Tickets that are shared with end-users can send CSAT surveys, but not internal, linked ones.\n\n\nQ389\nCan the CSAT survey have an expiry date? There is a way to prevent your customers from re-rating a conversation after too much time has passed. Head to Operator &gt; Task Bots and configure the settings for \"When a conversation is closed.\" This will prevent your customers from changing their rating after the fact, but this won’t prevent them from giving their initial rating.\n\n\nQ390\nHow can I disable CSAT surveys for customers on inbound conversations? To disable the CSAT surveys that customers receive following a closed conversation, click into Operator and then scroll to the bottom of the Task Bot page.

Alternatively, if you have developer resources, you can use Intercom’s Webhooks and REST API to connect to the Zoho API and build your own integration.\n\n\nQ457\nHow can I sync leads and import contacts from Pipedrive to Intercom? The Pipedrive integration doesn’t import Pipedrive Contacts into Intercom directly. Instead, it allows you to create Pipedrive deals via Intercom for Contacts who exist in Pipedrive with the same Email address. To import Pipedrive Contacts into Intercom, you can export them from Pipedrive as a CSV file and then import them into Intercom as a CSV import. Make sure you’re mapping the email addresses to each other and if you are using user_ids, correctly map those as well.\n\n\nQ458\nHow do I set up Zapier integration with Intercom and ensure companies show up after setting up a workflow? Companies may not show up in Intercom after setting up a Zapier workflow if they don’t have any contacts (users/leads) attached to them. You can attach users/leads using Intercom’s REST API or a similar feature in Zapier.\n\n\nQ459\nCan I import a list of company domain names from a Google Spreadsheet into Intercom and have it show within the Inbox to highlight when one of these companies is chatting with us? You can import your user data to Intercom from a Google Sheet by exporting it as a CSV and then importing it to Intercom.\n\n\nQ460\nDoes Intercom support multiple brands in the same inbox, and what are the pricing and support options for different brands? Yes, Intercom supports multiple brands in the same inbox. Multi-brand Messenger support is included in Premium plans. For more information on pricing and specific plan details, it’s best to contact the sales team or book a meeting with a sales representative who can provide more information on the available options.\n\n\nQ461\nDoes Intercom have a white label plan? Intercom does not have white label plans. However, we can help you find a way to reach your goals with our available features.\n\n\nQ462\nWhat does \"Free\" mean for apps and integrations in Intercom? \"Free\" means the app is free to install in Intercom, and no specific subscription is required to install the app. However, the app itself may have separate charges inside its own platform, which Intercom has no control over.\n\n\nQ463\nWhat could be causing errors in the Intercom widget if it’s integrated into an iframe on a Shopify page? Intercom does not officially support integrating into iframes, which might be causing issues.\n\n\nQ464\nWhat video platforms does Intercom support for embedding, and what issues might prevent videos from working? Intercom supports embedding videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, Loom, JWPlayer, Microsoft Stream, Brightcove, and Synthesia. However, private videos cannot be embedded, only unlisted videos. If you’re experiencing issues with video embedding, it might be due to your Content Security Policy (CSP), which is not controlled by Intercom. You will need to update your CSP on your end for the videos to work.\n\n\nQ465\nWhat could be causing articles not to open in the Intercom chatbox? One possible cause is a defined Content Security Policy (CSP) on your site that blocks articles from Intercom being loaded. Update your Content Security Policy to resolve the issue.\n\n\nQ466\nWhat should I do if the keyboard shortcut for opening articles in the chat is not working? Try the following troubleshooting steps: 1. Perform a hard refresh (Command + Shift + R on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows). 2. Test in an incognito browser (Command + Shift + N on Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows). 3. Test a different browser. 4. Test an alternative wifi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phone. 5. Disable any browser extensions. If the issue persists, contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ467\nWhat should I do if the expanding button doesn’t display the article correctly? Check if the article expansion issue persists in other browsers and if other colleagues or customers are encountering the same issue. If the issue persists, contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ468\nHow can I use the collapsible component in my articles? To add content, select Collapsible Section from the toolbar and then press enter at the end of the collapsible section heading and type or paste existing information. You’ll notice the content within the collapsible section will be slightly indented and aligned with the heading. Use the down arrow key twice to exit the collapsible section.\n\n\nQ469\nWhy do I have to use H1 and H2 headings to make headings visible in the generated contents table when H1 should be correctly used only for the heading of the whole page otherwise it can be confusing for screen readers and other assistive technologies? The correct use of headings should be H2 and H3. The title of an article will be listed as a header (not H1). It’s not possible to edit the HTML format for the article titles. However, you can use an H1 header in your articles with the title name for assistive technology purposes, and then use H2s or H3s to divide the sections within the article.\n\n\nQ470\nWhy is the title of our articles not marked with an h1 tag, and how can we use header tags for SEO purposes? The title of an article will be listed as a header (not H1), and it’s not possible to edit the HTML format for the article titles. However, you can use H1 headers in the article body for SEO purposes and use H2s or H3s to divide the sections within the article.\n\n\nQ471\nHow does changing the title of an article affect the URL, and can I update the title without changing the URL? Changing the title of an article can change the URL if the article’s title updates or if it is moved to a different collection. Typically, articles should automatically redirect when the title is changed or edits are made. There is no way to update the title without changing the URL. However, when you update your article names, the URL will update, but the Article ID will remain the same (and remain in the URL). That means links to previous versions of the article will still direct to the most current version.\n\n\nQ472\nDoes changing the title of an article automatically change the URL of the page? The URL for an article can change if the article’s title updates or if it is moved to a different collection. Typically articles should automatically redirect when the title is changed/edits are made.\n\n\nQ473\nWhy is the public link for my published article not working? Make sure your Help Center is turned on. You can turn on your Help Center website from Articles &gt; Help Center settings &gt; Website publishing. Once it’s turned on, you should be able to access published articles by URL.\n\n\nQ474\nWhere can I find drafts of previously published articles? If the articles are published with a pending draft, you’ll find them within the Status dropdown under ‘All articles’ or ‘Published with pending draft’. You can also click on the article and you’ll see the option with the draft version.\n\n\nQ475\nWhy am I not seeing all of my articles in FIN and how do I restart my demo? Drafts won’t show up in Fin as they aren’t available in the Help Center to reference back to end-users. Make sure you are using the correct URL which is the base of your Help Center, not from within a Collection. To restart the demo, you’ll need to start a new one from the demo site. It’s recommended to change your email to something like yourname+1@yourdomain.com when starting a new demo.\n\n\nQ476\nHow do I update and sync articles in Fin, especially when using the Fin demo? When using the Fin demo, new articles added to your help center won’t automatically show up. To update and sync articles, you’ll need to re-submit the URL for Fin to scan and learn from it. Once Fin is enabled for your workspace, you’ll have an option to periodically sync your content to ensure it stays up to date.\n\n\nQ477\nHow can I update the Fin demo with the most recent Help Desk articles? To update the public Fin demo with the most recent Help Desk articles, you can run the demo again with the same email address, and the content should sync. However, sometimes it doesn’t sync properly. In that case, a best practice would be to run the demo again with the same URL, but use a +1 modifier after your email handle (e.g., user+1@example.com).\n\n\nQ478\nHow does Fin bot interact with Help Center updates, and does the Fin demo live crawl the Help Center? Fin bot keeps up with any edits that you make in your Help Center Articles. The updates are usually instantaneous (up to 3 minutes at most) and don’t require a browser refresh on the customer’s end to share the newest information. The Fin demo, however, does not update live. It creates a \"snapshot\" of your Help Center at the time. If you want to test changes, you can make a new Demo using the same URL but change the email you use, like adding a \"+1\" to the email address.\n\n\nQ479\nHow can I set up the Fin bot for my organization and ensure it scans all the content in our Help Centre? In order for Fin to use all of your articles, they have to be published, be part of a collection, and be part of a live Help Center. Make sure there are no drafted articles or articles not in collections, as this might cause Fin not to utilize all of them.\n\n\nQ480\nHow long does it take for Fin to appear on our site after enabling it, and what should I do if it’s not appearing? Scanning and syncing external content usually takes about 10 minutes, but it can take up to 10 hours. If you’re only using Intercom Articles, your content will already be available and ready to use. Fin syncs external content weekly. If you want it to update immediately, it’s best to delete the imported content and reimport. If Fin is not appearing on your site after a reasonable amount of time, you can contact customer support for further assistance. They may need to investigate your account and ensure that Fin is activated correctly.\n\n\nQ481\nHow can I optimize and import content for Fin to access my entire website? To optimize your support content for better performance with Fin, follow these best practices: . Simplify language. Create a scannable structure. Identify who the content is aimed at. Audit for accuracy. Explain key terms. Fin is struggling to find content from your knowledge base and only showing 1 page imported, check if the URL structure is correct when importing content. If all else fails, try removing any subpaths from the URL (ex. use https://example.myhelpcenter.io instead of https://example.myhelpcenter.io/content).\n\n\nQ482\nDoes Fin transcribe videos from articles to answer questions to customers? At the moment, Fin only supports content sync from a URL, not from uploaded files like images, video, PDFs, or CSVs. This includes files that are embedded or linked on your Help Center page. The best workaround is copying the information from the file into the body of a Help Center article.\n\n\nQ483\nCan Fin learn based on our saved responses data? Currently, Fin is built to only take in data from your Intercom Help Center or a 3rd-party Knowledge Base. If you have material in your Saved Responses that you want Fin to consider when creating a response, you will want to make sure it is also documented in a Help Center article or in one of your ingested 3rd party links.\n\n\nQ484\nCan I train Fin using custom answers? No, at the moment Fin only learns from Articles and External Sources. It does defer to Custom Answers if they exist so that it can give specific answers that you’ve set up there, but it doesn’t learn from those answers.\n\n\nQ485\nHow does Fin behave in conversations and is it available for setting up during the beta phase? Fin’s behavior in conversations can be customized in the \"How Fin should behave\" section of a Fin profile. There are several modes for Fin behavior: Answer multiple questions, Answer multiple questions and never pass to teammate, and Only answer once. Each mode has its own options for handling multiple questions and what happens when Fin can’t find an answer. As for availability, Fin is currently being rolled out slowly to ensure it’s in great shape for the general release. If your workspace is not yet opted into Fin, you won’t be able to set it live. You can join the waitlist for Fin to be notified when it’s available for your workspace.\n\n\nQ486\nHow can I join the Fin waitlist, what is the pricing, and how are resolutions calculated for cost? To join the Fin waitlist, click on the Join waitlist button on the Fin product page. Fin is priced at $1.90 per resolution. are defined as the number of conversations in which Fin served an answer and there was no teammate reply or the end-user didn’t ask to talk to the team. includes both assumed resolutions (when the end-user did not confirm and exits the conversation without requesting further assistance) and confirmed resolutions (when the end-user confirmed it helped using a quick reply button or sending an affirmative response).\n\n\nQ487\nWhat is the cost of Fin and how is it calculated for a specific number of resolutions per day? How did Intercom come up with the pricing for Fin? The cost of Fin is calculated as $1.90 per resolution. For example, if Fin resolves 150 questions a day, the cost would be $1.90 x 150 resolutions per day x 30 days in a month, which equals $8550. Intercom priced Fin at cost to empower customers to be first movers and leaders in AI customer service.\n\n\nQ488\nCan we go back to using Resolution Bot if we do not want to continue with Fin past the trial period? You can certainly trial the AI Answers functionality and if you don’t prefer it once the trial is over, you have the option to stop using AI Answers, and continue using Custom Answers only (formerly known as Resolution Bot answers).\n\n\nQ489\nWhat should I do if my contract says I have access to FIN, but it shows my trial has ended? At the moment, there are no trial extension capabilities for Fin. The trial period starts when you set a Fin profile live and lasts for 14 days from that time.\n\n\nQ490\nWhen can I get access to the AI bot and how can I join the beta? Fin will gradually invite more customers to join the AI bot beta in the next few weeks. However, specific timing for when you’ll get access cannot be guaranteed. You will be kept updated on the progress. It is out of the control of customer support agents to grant access.\n\n\nQ491\nHow do I activate the AI assist feature in my inbox? First, check if you have joined the beta program. If you have any issues, contact customer support for assistance.\n\n\nQ492\nHow can I access AI Assistant if it’s not available in my workspace? You should be able to opt-in to AI Assist from within the UI. However, if you don’t see the option, it might be because your workspace does not have a subscription or the feature is not available for your region. Contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ493\nIs AI Assist available for EU hosted workspaces and what happens after the trial period? The AI Assist beta is currently not available on EU and AUS data hosted workspaces. However, if your workspace is on the US Data Hosting Region, you can use the feature. As it is a beta, there is no confirmation on what will happen after the trial period. Keep an eye on updates and announcements from the company for more information.\n\n\nQ494\nHow do I enable the AI Assist beta on some of my workspaces? To enable the AI Assist beta on specific workspaces, provide the workspace IDs of the workspaces you want to opt into the beta. Click \"Create Ticket\" and follow the prompts to get your selected workspaces added to the AI beta. Once the request is processed, you will receive a notification, and the AI beta will be enabled in your workspaces after refreshing your page.\n\n\nQ495\nHow can I activate Fin for our workspace? Currently, Fin is being rolled out slowly. You can join the waitlist and you’ll be notified when it’s ready for you to use in your workspace. In the meantime, you can read articles on how to best prepare for Fin and try out Fin with your own Help Center content.\n\n\nQ496\nWhen will Fin be available and when is the general release? Fin is currently being rolled out slowly to ensure it’s in great shape for the general release. You can join the waitlist and you’ll be notified when it’s ready for you to try in your own workspace. There is no public product roadmap, but you will be notified when the general release happens.\n\n\nQ497\nDoes Fin work with other languages, specifically Dutch and German, and when will they be available? Fin is currently only capable of working with English content and does not support Dutch or German at the moment. Our teams are working hard to add even more languages for Fin. I can’t give any specific details at this time, but we will let everyone know as soon as new languages are available!\n\n\nQ498\nIs Fin available in Spanish and Portuguese? Currently, our Fin AI Answers Bot is only officially supported in English. However, the team is aware of the interest in having it available in other languages, such as Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\nQ499\nWhen will multilingual support for the AI bot be available? There is no public roadmap for multilingual support, but the AI bot is initially designed to work in English, with plans to add support for additional languages soon. Keep an eye on the Product Changes page for updates.\n\n\nQ500\nWhen is it planned to launch the AI bot in other languages, specifically Russian? We are looking to launch the AI bot in multiple languages within the coming few months. This is a highly requested feature and our product team is currently working on it.\n\n\nQ501\nCan users choose a language for the resolution bot, and will the messages be translated to English when received in the inbox? Users cannot choose the language that the bot will reply to. Resolution Bot will preferentially deliver the answer matching the user’s browser locale. Messages won’t be automatically translated to English. You would have to use an Inbox integration, such as Unbabel, or explore other translation apps on the App Store.\n\n\nQ502\nHow can I change the language of my Resolution Bot answers and enable it to answer multiple questions in the same conversation? To change the language of your Resolution Bot answers, create a new answer and choose the language of your response. The bot will automatically match the answer to the settings of your customer. Note that you will need to create separate answers for each language, as Intercom does not translate your answers to other languages for you. set your Resolution Bot to answer multiple questions in the same conversation, you can enable Looping Mode by creating a Bot Behaviour in Operator &gt; Resolution Bot &gt; Behaviours and then enabling Looping mode under the Bot Mode section.\n\n\nQ503\nCan I replicate answers within the Resolution Bot for multiple unique questions? Currently, there is no way to duplicate a Resolution Bot answer. You will need to manually create and update the answer flows for each unique question.\n\n\nQ504\nCan I customize bot reply buttons, including Resolution Bot reply buttons? You can write your own phrases for Custom Bot quick reply buttons, including setting customer reply options such as reply buttons, data attribute collectors, and follow-up actions. However, Resolution Bot reply buttons are not customizable at this time. Your suggestion for customizing Resolution Bot reply buttons has been logged for the product team to review.\n\n\nQ505\nHow can we prevent a ticket or conversation from being assigned to an agent when it’s being handled by a resolution bot? To stop this behavior, enable the Bot Inbox by going to Operator &gt; Settings &gt; Turn on the bot inbox. This feature creates a separate inbox for bot conversations, so that when your Resolution Bot is dealing with a customer, assignment rules are not being applied.\n\n\nQ506\nHow can I regain the ability to assign tickets? First, check your permissions to ensure you have the necessary rights to reassign conversations. If you still face issues, provide more context on the problem, such as a screencast or screenshots, and contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ507\nHow can I bulk assign a large number of tickets to a specific team? To bulk assign tickets, go to ‘All’ on the left-hand side bar. Select one conversation and then hit the minus icon to select every conversation. After this, click the arrow (assign to a person or team inbox button) and select the team inbox to assign them to.\n\n\nQ508\nHow can I bulk message a subset of users and have those messages open and assigned to a specific team? You can send Outbound content like post or email to a customer. During creation, there is an option to have replies assigned to a certain team. You can also create a rule set that assigns replies to outbound content to specific teams.\n\n\nQ509\nHow can I send an email to a set group of emails from a CSV? When you import people from a CSV, a certain tag will be added to them (or you can add your own tag to these people). Afterwards, you can use this tag as a filter in your email audience rules.\n\n\nQ510\nHow do I send a new email out to people who did not open a certain email? To do this, tag all users who have already opened the email. Then, use the same rules of the first email in the new email, except now add the rule \"Tag is not XXX\" to remove all of those users you previously tagged.\n\n\nQ511\nIs it possible to have more than one email associated to a single user? You can add a second email address as a custom attribute for your users. However, just know that anything sent out will always go out to the primary email address on file.\n\n\nQ512\nWhy is the wrong email being sent/displayed from the customer when they write to us after changing it, and how does the email update process work? The issue might be related to the email address being sent via the JavaScript snippet when the user logs in. Please check with your team to see what value is being sent when the user logs in. If the email is updated manually from UI and then when user sends a ping (when they log in) and at that point of time if JavaScript snippet sends a different email the email that is sent via JS snippet will be the one that will appear in the User profile in Intercom.\n\n\nQ513\nHow can I modify my email address? If your workspace does not have SAML SSO enabled, you can change your email address associated with your account by going to Your Account &gt; Your Details and replacing the email address you are currently using with the address you would like it changed to. Then, click \"Save Changes\". If you’ve signed up with Google SSO, follow these steps: 1. Log out of your Intercom account 2. Go to the Login page and request a password reset 3. Go to your email client and follow the instructions for changing your password 4. Log back in to Intercom using your email and newly reset password. You should now have the option to update your email address by going to the Your Settings section.\n\n\nQ514\nHow can I log in with my new email if Intercom remembers my previous email? If you sign in using SSO, you cannot update your email directly. Instead, you will need to invite the new email as a new teammate in your workspace and give that new account all of your same permissions, teams, etc.\n\n\nQ515\nHow do I update my email address to a different one? If your workspace does not have SAML SSO enabled, you can change your email address associated with your account by going to Your Account &gt; Your Details and replacing the email address you are currently using with the address you would like it changed to. Then, click \"Save Changes\". If your workspace does have SAML SSO enabled, you will not be able to edit your email address, as your email address is important to the SAML SSO authentication process. Instead, you’ll need to invite the email address as a new teammate, then remove the old one.\n\n\nQ516\nHow can I prevent customers from seeing my colleague’s email address and resolve permission issues when changing email settings? To prevent customers from seeing your colleague’s email address, send emails to users from your company email address. You can set it up through your email settings. If you encounter permission issues when changing email settings, go to the teammates section of your workspace’s General Settings. Here, you can edit the permissions of each teammate. An admin or a teammate with admin permissions needs to enable the required permissions for the affected teammate.\n\n\nQ517\nHow can I disable or hide the teammate city information? To hide the teammate city information from end users, each teammate can disable it individually by going to their profile page. They can find this option in the settings under teammates. They just need to select edit on their profile page and turn off the teammate city visibility.\n\n\nQ518\nHow can I change or hide the location on my account? You cannot edit the location information directly. However, you can hide your location from your profile page from end users in conversations by checking the tickbox below your location that says \"Hide location from users\" in your account settings.\n\n\nQ519\nHow do I set up a user location via the API? We receive our geo-location data based on the User’s IP address from a third-party service, called Maxmind. We have no control over this data, so it’s not possible to set this manually via API.\n\n\nQ520\nHow are user locations obtained and why might they be incorrect? User locations are obtained based on their IP address from a third-party service called Maxmind. Incorrect locations could be due to the use of a VPN, traveling, or inaccuracies in the data. You can file a data correction request through Maxmind’s website if you believe the data is incorrect.\n\n\nQ521\nHow can I see a customer’s IP address? We don’t have a built-in feature to grab a user’s IP address - this is not information that we can freely pull and share. Our customers can’t use IP addresses in Intercom as tracking info. Per our Privacy policy and our Law Enforcement Request Guidelines, we are not able to provide any sensitive information from our database without a subpoena.\n\n\nQ522\nHow can I identify the platform my customer is using when they contact me via Intercom? If the user contacts you via the iOS or Android mobile app, you will see the Apple or Android logo beneath the user’s message. If the user is on mobile web (web browser on a mobile device), the same icon will appear as if the user is on the Messenger on desktop. If you hover over the icon, you can also see the source URL, the browser, and the OS the user is on. This should be able to tell you whether the user is on a desktop or mobile device.\n\n\nQ523\nHow can I check if the conversation was initiated from a Desktop or Mobile? If you hover over the chat icon, you’ll see the device an end-user is on.\n\n\nQ524\nHow can I identify if a conversation is a chat or an email conversation in Intercom? In Intercom, if it states ‘Reply’, it would be a Messenger (chat) conversation, whereas ‘Email’ would indicate an email conversation.\n\n\nQ525\nHow can I distinguish between requests received from customers via email and conversations that came via web chat in Intercom? You can identify email conversations by the icon in the message. For email, you will also see the composer will be \"Email\" instead of \"Reply\".\n\n\nQ526\nHow can I identify the source of customer messages, differentiate between chat and email messages, and find the specific URL where the chat message was written? You can view the source URL of a conversation by going to the initial message and hovering over the chat icon. The symbol for a chat conversation will be a speech bubble, which helps you differentiate between chat and email messages. To find the specific URL where the chat message was written, you can also hover over the chat icon in the initial message.\n\n\nQ527\nHow can I check what page the customer was on when they came on web chat? You can check where the customer is coming from by hovering over the little messenger icon in the first message they sent. It is also available via API if you need it.\n\n\nQ528\nHow can I see the URL a user is on when they send a message? You can see the URL a user is on when they send a message by hovering over the Messenger icon, which will display the source URL.\n\n\nQ529\nIs there a way to have a direct URL to the messenger bot? It is possible to create a Custom Launcher if you’d like the Messenger to launch from a specific button, link, or element in your app, site, or mobile app.\n\n\nQ530\nCan I link directly to live chat? Yes, you can create a Custom Launcher which would allow the Messenger to launch from a specific button, link, or element in your app, site, or mobile app.\n\n\nQ531\nHow can I restrict access to live chat for specific users or groups? You can restrict access to live chat for specific users or groups by setting a condition of when to show a Messenger launcher. This can be done in the Messenger settings page under the Content tab. Set it to show to all users except the ones with specified IDs. You can add more User IDs, exclude a whole company, or users with email addresses from a particular company’s domain. Explore the available filters to find the best option for your needs. Setting the condition will prevent the Messenger launcher from appearing to the specified user(s) when they are logged in.\n\n\nQ532\nHow to add a new display condition to show the messenger launcher? To control who can see the Messenger launcher on your website and add display conditions, refer to this article: Control who can see the Messenger launcher on your site. The article explains how to get more targeted with who can see the launcher, as well as how to show or hide the launcher for selected leads or users.\n\n\nQ533\nHow do I hide the messenger launcher for some pages? To hide the Messenger launcher for specific pages, you can update your Messenger settings to include \"Current page URL is not [page to exclude]\". If you’re using multiple URL filters, make sure to combine negative filters (\"is not\", \"does not contain\") with an AND (\"Match all\") instead of an OR (\"Match any\") so that all of the criteria will be checked.\n\n\nQ534\nHow can I definitively disable the Messenger popup? Go to Messenger &gt; Platforms &gt; Web &gt; Show the Messenger Launcher and toggle off the option to show the Messenger launcher for users or visitors. This will disable/remove the launcher in your app (or on your website) which allows your users to contact you, and see their past conversations with you. Your Messenger visibility settings will also apply to the Messenger on your Help Center. You can also disable it by removing the \"config.inbox.style = :default\" line from the rails gem.\n\n\nQ535\nHow can I show only the message screen instead of the \"Home\" screen in a chat widget? To remove the Home page from your messenger and only have the Messages page showing, you can disable the Home space for both Users and Visitors.\n\n\nQ536\nCan we set up the messenger to have different layouts for different audiences, like one has the compact view and another audience has the default view? We do not have a feature to show the Messenger in compact view or default based on the audience. The features that can be audience dependent are the spaces & apps, which can show visitors and users two different experiences.\n\n\nQ537\nHow can I manage conversation rating requests for specific customers and deal with Messenger installation notifications? To manage conversation rating requests for specific customers, there is currently no option to build criteria for sending conversation ratings. You can turn it on for all users or all visitors. However, as a workaround, you could have your teammates snooze specific conversations for 7 days to exempt the conversation from sending a rating. Regarding Messenger installation notifications, the issue might be due to an old workspace still existing in our system. It is recommended to report this to the support team to avoid further confusion.\n\n\nQ538\nHow can I prevent customers from changing their conversation ratings after leaving a comment? Currently, it’s not possible to prevent customers from changing their rating after leaving a comment. This feature might be considered for future updates.\n\n\nQ539\nWhat should I do if a customer can’t leave a rating in a conversation? If the customer is using Outlook, it might have blocked the pictures (emojis) from being downloaded through HTML. The customer can turn off the \"Don’t download pictures or other content automatically in HTML email\" option.

To include a satisfaction survey or conversation rating in your chatbot, you can add a ‘close a conversation’ action to your bot and enable default conversation rating to be sent, or add a survey at the end of the bot path. There are multiple ways to set this up depending on your specific scenario. If the survey does not appear during testing, keep in mind that the preview mode might not show the conversation rating being sent, as it shows the conversation flow before the conversation is closed.

A workaround might be using a 3rd party like Zapier to connect Intercom and Mixpanel together.\n\n\nQ557\nHow can I use dynamic URLs in Intercom Product Tours and set up system alerts in the messenger? To use dynamic URLs in Product Tours, adjust your URL settings in the audience steps. Use the URL \"contains\" option and select a consistent element across your URL. Make sure the UI you build the tour on will still match for the user receiving the tour. To set up system alerts in the messenger, you can use the Status Page app, which is available in the Intercom App Store.\n\n\nQ558\nWhy is a step in my Product Tour showing up on the wrong URL and how can I fix it? The issue might be caused by using dynamic CSS selectors in your Product Tour. You can add a special data attribute data-intercom-target=”…” to your HTML and then target that element to ensure that the tour sends properly. To fix the issue, you will need your development team to implement the data attribute in the HTML elements on your site. The guide provided should run through the exact steps you need to take: https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/2901138-edit-css-to-point-your-tour-at-the-right-website-elements.\n\n\nQ559\nWhat should I do if there is an issue with the location of a pointer step in a Product Tour? Check if the CSS selector for the pointer step is correct and present on the live page.

Note that the underlying CSS selectors may be different between your site in the tour preview mode and your live site.\n\n\nQ560\nWhy can’t I set my product tour live, even though I’ve finished everything? Double check that you completed any event triggers. Most commonly, the First seen event trigger is left blank, which prevents the Tour from going live. If you still face issues, ensure you have the necessary permissions in your workspace to set Product Tours live. Reach out to your team to ensure you have the necessary permissions.\n\n\nQ561\nWhy doesn’t our product tour show up for any users as intended? One possible reason is that you’re using an event trigger along with a URL rule. This would only trigger the tour if a user triggers the event while being on the specified page.\n\n\nQ562\nHow do I set up a specific product tour for users that sign up from a different page and target them correctly? To target users correctly for a product tour, avoid using the referral URL as it refers to the link the user was previously on before navigating to the current URL, not the URL they’ve used to sign up with. your page is a Single Page Application, make sure you’re correctly calling Intercom(‘update’) to tell Intercom when the URL changes. Consult with your development team to ensure Intercom(‘update’) is correctly implemented, which will help you target users based on the URL they are on.\n\n\nQ563\nHow can I make sure a Product Tour opens in the end user’s current tab? To control how tours open, you can use one of the following methods to open the tour in the same tab: . Automatically, by matching the audience rules and landing on the page where the tour is set up. . By clicking on the Tour Inserter app in an outbound message. . By clicking on a button on your site that uses our JavaScript ‘startTour’ method. the tour as a link will open it in a new tab.\n\n\nQ564\nHow do I trigger a product tour from a key stroke? You can trigger the Product Tour with an event you’re tracking on Intercom. To trigger the tour on a keystroke, you would need to track an event for whenever someone uses that keyboard shortcut. Your dev team would need to set this up on your website’s code and use the JS API method to submit the event to Intercom.\n\n\nQ565\nHow can I automatically tag users in real-time who complete a product tour as part of a checklist? Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to automate tagging users that completed a tour specifically within a checklist. The closest solution is to create a Series, create a Checklist in the Series, and then set up a rule to tag Users who’ve completed the Checklist.\n\n\nQ566\nHow can I get an overview of all the product tours my customer has been through? You can click into a particular user profile and check out the ‘recent content’ section for a summary of all of the recent Outbound content received by a user. However, it is not possible to filter this by only product tours, or to generate an all-time list for a particular user.\n\n\nQ567\nHow can I show different product tours on the same page using the series feature? If you want to show 2 different tours on the same page using Series, you can have the first tour come before the second tour in the Series path. You can include a Wait Block between the 2 if you want. This will make it so the second tour doesn’t send until a certain amount of time has passed.\n\n\nQ568\nHow can I enable going back one step in product tours? There is no way to enable going back one step in a product tour. The only option is restarting the tour completely.\n\n\nQ569\nHow can I set up a banner with a product tour and prevent the tour from launching before the banner?

There are a couple of options that can be used to preview a Series multiple times before setting it live to your users: 1. Duplicate the Series. 2. Use different test user accounts to test it each time. 3. Allow series re-entry,\n\n\nQ573\nHow do I reset a user’s progress in a series back to the start? Currently, you cannot manually restart a user in a series. As a workaround, you can have the user exit the series, duplicate the series, and target it at them. Add a unique tag to the user and use the tag as the exit rule. Once you duplicate the series, edit the entry rule to be just the tag so that only that user will enter.\n\n\nQ574\nHow can I have a specific user enter a Series at a designated point? To add a user to a Series at a specific point, you can create a separate entry block with the user’s email address as the rule and attach it to the place in the Series you want the user to enter. This specific entry rule will only enter them at that point and they will not receive previous messages in the Series.\n\n\nQ575\nHow do I set a series live and resolve the \"recurring emails must be sent from addresses with custom domains\" error? When a series has re-entry enabled in the entry rules, it means one user can receive the email multiple times. In this case, it is only possible to send the email from a custom domain. To set the series live, you need to change the ‘from’ address to a custom domain.\n\n\nQ576\nI’m not getting the verification email for a custom sender email address. What should I do?

A red alert can appear in messages when the sender has configured their Reply-To address in their email settings to be different from their From address. This is an email header used by the sender to specify which email address should receive replies. This issue is due to a setting on the end user’s side and cannot be changed within Intercom. Intercom uses the From field of an email to identify the sender, but sometimes, with contact forms or some email forwarding configurations, the sender may be changed to the account doing the forwarding, instead of the original sender.\n\n\nQ587\nHow can I set up an email in the new Outbound section with a custom \"from\" and \"reply to\" address? To have a custom address route to your email inbox rather than the Intercom inbox, you can set up email forwarding with that custom support address on your email provider side. Any email hitting your email inbox would be forwarded into Intercom.\n\n\nQ588\nHow can I find a sent email in Intercom? There are a couple of ways to find a sent email in Intercom. 1. If you know the user, you can search in their user profile and see the emails that they have not responded to. Note that if the user has not responded to an email, it will not appear as a conversation in the Inbox. 2.

You can also search conversations by Conversation ID.\n\n\nQ590\nHow can I search for specific conversations in Intercom using keywords from our team members? To search your conversations, click the search icon on the top left. Then, start typing your keywords and conversations will automatically be returned that match your search. Note that the entire conversation thread will be included in the search, and it’s currently not possible to filter out only teammate replies.\n\n\nQ591\nHow can I set up keyword monitoring and email notifications based on specific terms in Intercom? You can set up an Inbox rule to get emails assigned to you if the customer is using specific words. Go to Settings &gt; Inbox rules &gt; Click on New rule. Create a rule adding the \"When\", \"if\" and \"then\" conditions and add the “message contains” filter. Once you’ve added the rules, the emails should start getting routed if the customer uses any of those specific words in the email.\n\n\nQ592\nIs there a way to have different notifications in Intercom (sound or visual) based on the channel used by the customer to contact the support team: Email or Live Chat?

Views in a banner and post correspond to unique users, meaning that one view is one user. However, if a visitor uses a different device to view the post/banner, it will count as another visitor because the cookies don’t carry over. In the case of a post shown on the website, \"sent\" means that the customer has come online and the post is triggered for them. A post is an in-app message, so a matching customer must come online to receive it. The post message is queued for them and won’t be sent until they come online. A post is marked as \"opened\" as soon as it is displayed to the user. If customers have any previously unread messages, these types of messages will not be counted as opened.\n\n\nQ607\nHow can I understand and manage post metrics, such as exporting user engagement data and resending posts to unopened recipients? You can export the list of users who opened, clicked, etc. by exporting a CSV report. When counting message sends, each receipt of the message is shown in the stats to accurately track all stats for a message. To resend a post only to those who it was sent to but didn’t open, you\n\n\nQ608\nHow do I export a list of users that opened a post? Currently, it is not possible to export a list of users that opened a post directly. However, you can go into your contact page and check their messages and conversations if they have responded to the post.\n\n\nQ609\nIs it possible to export archived users? Unfortunately, users that have been archived are not visible in the UI.\n\n\nQ610\nWhat are the consequences of archiving a user, how can I manage and view archived users, and how can I un-archive a user? When you archive a user, they become invisible in the UI and are not counted towards your tracked users number. Archiving acts as a soft delete, so if the person returns (by logging in or being manually added), all data will be restored, including all associated conversations. To confirm if a user has been successfully archived, you can try searching for them in the user list. If they don’t appear, they have likely been archived. To un-archive a user, they can either log in or be manually added, which will restore all their data and associated conversations.\n\n\nQ611\nHow do I bulk delete users who were last seen 1 year ago or more? If you’d like to archive an entire group of users, first find the users you want to archive using filters, then click \"Archive\". , you can also use our standard API endpoints to archive users. I recommend creating a CSV export before archiving if this is information you would like to view or add back to Intercom at a later date.\n\n\nQ612\nWhat happens to phone logs in Intercom if a customer wants to be GDPR cleared? Will the log stay or will it also be removed with the user?

To unlink an email from Intercom and stop using it for responding to messages, you need to remove the email forwarding settings in your email provider. The process may vary depending on the email provider you use. Generally, you need to access your email provider’s settings and disable email forwarding to your Intercom email address.\n\n\nQ615\nHow do I disable the reassign replies function and why does it turn on automatically? The reassign replies button turns on automatically due to a setting in Intercom that changes your away mode after a certain amount of time. To disable this feature, check the settings by selecting Settings &gt; Inbox Settings &gt; Automatic away mode.\n\n\nQ616\nHow to turn off automatic away mode? To turn off automatic away mode, navigate to Settings &gt; Inbox settings &gt; Automatic away mode and disable both inactivity thresholds. Keep in mind that this will apply to all teammates in the workspace and is not configurable for individual teammates.\n\n\nQ617\nHow can I fix the issue of automatically showing a previously forwarded message when trying to send an email? The forwarded message might be coming from your email forwarding settings. To turn this off, go to Settings &gt; Email &gt; Email Forwarding. If you do not have permission to update this setting, reach out to a teammate to grant you permission.\n\n\nQ618\nWhy does the messenger show a message during login even though we didn’t set it up like that? How can I prevent it from showing a message? The message you’re seeing is found in Task Bot typical reply times for Leads. If you turn this off, the message will stop appearing. It’s appearing before sign in because it’s for Leads who do not have an account yet. You’re welcome to leave it on for Users.\n\n\nQ619\nHow can I have Messenger automatically open for first-time visitors to display a custom bot offering one-on-one help without them having to click it open? This can be achieved by programming it with the help of your engineering team. All the necessary documentation can be found in our development docs.\n\n\nQ620\nWhat should I do if the messenger doesn’t load until I click the button twice? Please provide a recording or screenshots of the issue, and share any relevant information about the page where the issue is occurring.\n\n\nQ621\nHow can I resolve technical issues affecting the mobile messenger display and logo inside our app (mobile SDK)? First, make sure you are using the latest version of the SDK. If the issue persists, provide a screen recording of the behavior and the affected user’s profile URL to customer support for further investigation. For issues related to the logo disappearing, also include the logo image when contacting customer support.\n\n\nQ622\nHow can I resolve technical issues affecting the mobile messenger display and logo inside our app (mobile SDK)?

For issues related to the logo disappearing, also include the logo image when contacting customer support.\n\n\nQ623\nWhat should I do if words are moved to a new line in the messenger? This is a known issue and our engineers are currently working on it. Customer support will log your case for further investigation and keep you posted on any updates.\n\n\nQ624\nWhy are deleted posts still visible in the messenger even after clearing browser cache and history? By deleting a Post message, it should no longer be visible in the user’s conversation list in the Messenger. However, the message will still be visible for your teammates in the message/conversation history on a user’s profile.\n\n\nQ625\nDo users see it when we delete a message? When a message is deleted, the user will no longer see the contents of the deleted message. The deleted message will appear differently in the Messenger for both the user and the support team. It’s not possible to remove this disclaimer from the conversation.\n\n\nQ626\nHow can I recall a message sent to multiple recipients and what happens when I delete a message? You can delete a reply in the inbox by clicking the three dots next to the message and selecting \"Delete message.\" However, replies sent by email can’t be deleted from your user’s email client. If your user doesn’t see your reply in the Messenger within two minutes, an email notification with the conversation will be sent to the user, which you also can’t delete. If the end-user is viewing the conversation from the messenger, it will appear as ‘This message was deleted’ so they will no longer be able to see it. However, there is no control to retract a message that was sent to an end-users email as this would be gone to an email provider such as Google, which there is no access to.\n\n\nQ627\nCan I retract an email or chat message I sent to a customer? Unfortunately, once an email is sent to a customer, it cannot be retracted. However, you can delete a reply from a conversation in the Inbox, which will remove it from the user interface. For chat replies, if the message hasn’t been seen within 2 minutes, it will automatically send an email reply. Therefore, it’s important to delete it within 2 minutes to prevent the email from being sent. However, if it’s an email reply, there is no way to delete it after it has been sent.\n\n\nQ628\nHow can I find what message was deleted in an inbox conversation? There isn’t any way to check this. Once the message has been deleted there isn’t anyway to undo or recover.\n\n\nQ629\nWhy would a deleted macro show as a suggested reply in my conversations? If the macro was deleted recently, it may still take some time for a new smart reply to be generated for you.\n\n\nQ630\nHow can I report on every user who has received a Macro from us in the chat and tag all the conversations that used a specific macro? Currently, there is no direct reporting on Macro usage. However, you can try filtering the conversation with a specific line or words from the macro through the search option in the Inbox. Unfortunately, the option to tag all conversations using a specific macro is not available at this stage.\n\n\nQ631\nHow can I view and export macro data, including owner information and visibility, for quality assurance purposes? You can export your macro data from the Macro Settings, which contains information such as name, visibility, created at, owner, updated at, type, and date. The report contains all macros, and macros that are not visible to others will have the \"visibility\" column listed as \"owner\" (meaning only the owner of the macro can use it). To view the content of the macros, you can use a workaround by going to a specific URL with your app ID and then using a JSON query tool to extract the contents of each macro. However, this workaround won’t give you owner information or usage details. For that, you should use the regular Export option.\n\n\nQ632\nIs there a way I can view the macros scoped to an owner who isn’t myself? At the moment, personal macros are only visible to the specific teammate that created the macro. Only shared macros can be viewed and edited from the settings in the workspace by teammates with the required permissions.\n\n\nQ633\nHow can I troubleshoot and resolve issues with saving macros? To troubleshoot and resolve issues with saving macros, follow these steps: 1. Perform a hard refresh of your browser. 2. Log into the platform in an incognito browser and see if the issue persists. 3. Log into the platform on a different web browser and see if the issue persists. If the issue still occurs, clear your cache and cookies, and check your browser’s console for any errors. If the issue persists after these steps, contact customer support and provide them with the name of the macro and any additional details about the issue. They can investigate further and help resolve the problem.\n\n\nQ634\nHow can I save and close an email when I get the message \"The cells on one of your table blocks contains another table\"? Please try the following steps:. Perform a hard refresh (Command + Shift + R on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows). Clear your cache and disable extensions. Test in an incognito browser (Command + Shift + N on Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows). Test a different browser than the one you’re using. Test an alternative wifi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phonethese steps don’t make a difference, please contact customer support with the URL of the message.\n\n\nQ635\nWhat should I do if I haven’t received my requested CSV export or if I’m still not receiving it after multiple attempts? First, check your spam or junk folder to see if the email landed there. If you still can’t find it, try a hard refresh of your browser, or open an incognito browser and log in to your account to attempt the export again. If the issue persists, check your browser’s Console for any errors and contact customer support with the details.\n\n\nQ636\nWhat should I do if I don’t receive the CSV report I requested? Check if the email address associated with your account is accurate and can receive emails. If the issue persists, contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ637\nHow can I troubleshoot issues with CSV export? To troubleshoot issues with CSV export, please try exporting your CSV from an incognito browser and check if the issue persists. If it does, it would be helpful to see some screenshots or a recording outlining the issue along with console errors. You can access the console by pressing Ctrl-Shift-K OR from the browser menu by clicking Menu &gt; Web Developer &gt; Web Console. After you’ve cleared the console, please try to replicate the issue. Any errors that occur will appear in red — take a screenshot of those and share it with the support team for further assistance.\n\n\nQ638\nHow can I check the entire export history of everyone and which leads they exported? You can check the Admin activities in Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Teammate activity log. There you can select a particular teammate, date range, and action. In this case, you would need to pick Bulk export. This will show if and when your teammate exported users. However, you are not able to see which leads were exported.\n\n\nQ639\nWhy is there a discrepancy between the team performance report and the export per interaction, and how does the date range affect the customer support export? The team performance report can include extra conversations as it will include conversations that were created on a previous date and then replied to on the date in the report. The conversation data export can show a lower number as this will only show conversations created on the specific date rather than also including those created before this and replied to on that date. The customer support export is showing conversations \"created at\" prior to the selected date because these conversations were started earlier, but the first end user response on the conversation was on the selected date. This is why they are included in the export.\n\n\nQ640\nHow can I export conversations labeled under AI Answer resolutions? You cannot export those conversations directly from the Fin report. However, you can create a Custom Report with that data and export the conversations from that Custom Report. Use the metric \"Fin resolved conversations\" in your Custom Report.\n\n\nQ641\nHow can I extract and export message data, including content and performance, for analysis and integration with data lakes? You can export a CSV of your Series, which will provide a report of checkpoints, opens, receipts, and completions. This will allow you to analyze message content and performance data. Check out this article on exporting message data for more details.\n\n\nQ642\nHow can I add specific messages to a view in Outbound? You can’t add specific messages directly to a view in Outbound, as these views are created using filters. However, you can add a tag to the message and then add the filter \"tag is [example]\" to the segment. Any messages with that tag will be added to the view.\n\n\nQ643\nWhat counts as an \"outbound message\" in your pricing calculation? An outbound message refers to targeted email, mobile push, and in-app messages that encourage customers to take action or convert visitors to loyal customers.\n\n\nQ644\nWill starting a campaign through messages affect the billing if it’s through chat? Starting a campaign through messages may affect your billing depending on your current plan and usage. It’s best to review your plan details and consult with customer support for specific information.\n\n\nQ645\nIf I unsubscribe, will that disable the chat bot on my site? No, unsubscribing will not disable the chat bot on your site. It will only remove you from the email list. You can still use the Messenger to contact customer support if needed.\n\n\nQ646\nHow can I exclude a URL from chats and is there a universal setting to do so? You can exclude a URL from chats under the Rules section &gt; \"Where to send\" by selecting a URL rule. However, there is no global setting to exclude URLs from firing chats. You would need to add the rules to each outbound message you have running or uninstall Intercom on those pages (although it won’t track user data in that case).\n\n\nQ647\nHow can I minimize or prevent spam hits from a specific region on my website chatbot? To minimize or prevent spam hits from a specific region, you can restrict the ability to start a conversation based on the Continent code attribute in your Messenger Settings. This will keep the launcher available, but users from the restricted region won’t be able to start a conversation with you. Alternatively, you can restrict this in other ways, such as only allowing logged-in users to start a conversation or restricting the launcher entirely.\n\n\nQ648\nHow can I suppress sending outbound messages to contacts from certain countries? To suppress sending outbound messages to contacts from certain countries, you can use a \"Country is not\" filter under the audience rules, and separate multiple country filters with an AND grouping.\n\n\nQ649\nHow can I display content for visitors only on specific devices, such as PCs and not on smartphones? To display content for visitors only on specific devices, like PCs and not on smartphones, you should use negative AND rules instead of negative OR rules. For example, set the rule to not target customers on Android AND not target customers on iOS. This will ensure that the message is only displayed on PCs.\n\n\nQ650\nHow can I target a custom bot on a specific website? To target only a specific website with a custom bot, add a Page URL rule in your Audience targeting.\n\n\nQ651\nHow can I set up different custom bots for different Facebook pages and ensure consistent performance? To set up different custom bots for different Facebook pages, use the source URL on Facebook and filter for Page URL contains the specific page URL. This will allow you to set up custom bots for each Facebook page. However, it is recommended to use \"is\" instead of \"contains\" for the Facebook URL, as using \"contains\" can sometimes cause inconsistent performance.\n\n\nQ652\nWhy were two bots triggered despite the prioritization, and how can I ensure only one assignment takes place? Two bots were triggered despite the prioritization because this is expected behavior for the new Custom Bot workflows. All Custom Bots that are considered \"background\" bots can trigger, in order of prioritization, even if there’s multiple assignments and closes of conversation. However, as soon as a \"foreground\" bot triggers, no more bots will be evaluated. Foreground bots are ones that send any messages to the end-user. To ensure only one assignment takes place, you can place the bots into one bot and use Conditional branching to ensure only one path is taken.\n\n\nQ653\nHow does audience targeting and profile priority work in AI bots when using multiple profiles? When using multiple profiles, the matched figure represents the number of people that have matched a specific AI bot profile. If you have a higher priority profile targeting a specific audience, it will catch those users first, leaving only the remaining users for the lower priority profile. In the case of a new AI bot trial profile with higher priority, any user within its targeted audience will match that profile first. The previous bot profile targets additional audiences, but since the higher priority profile catches users first, only the remaining users will be picked up by the previous bot profile.\n\n\nQ654\nDo top level domains need to match between the help center and the app for the targeted audience feature to work? Yes, if your Help Center doesn’t share a top-level domain with your web app, users who are logged-in on your app will be seen as logged-out leads within the Help Center. To avoid this, set up a custom domain for your Help Center that matches the top-level domain of your web app. You will need to be using the Messenger in your product for logged-in users, as well as having a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled.\n\n\nQ655\nHow can I enable audience targeting in Help Center settings and set up a custom domain? To enable audience targeting in Help Center settings, you need to be using the Messenger in your product for logged-in users and have a custom domain with cookie forwarding enabled. Using a custom domain is mandatory for audience targeting.\n\n\nQ656\nHow can I manage cookie settings and stay updated on new features? Currently, it’s not possible to control the cookies on the Help Center product, but it has been prioritized by the product team to implement. You can find all cookie-related information on the company’s website under their cookie policy. To stay updated on new features, keep an eye on the Product Changes page, where new features are typically announced.\n\n\nQ657\nWhat are the options for customizing the appearance of our help center to match our company branding? The available customizations for the Help Center include adding a logo, adding links to the header, adjusting the layout of content, showing authors and their avatars, adding a table of contents, adding links to the footer, adding links to your social media, and styling (changing the color of your Help Center, text color, and background and text footer in the footer). However, custom design options are limited, and it is not possible to create a fully custom look.\n\n\nQ658\nHow can I manage links and related articles in the Help Center? To show Related Articles, you can go to the Help Center Settings &gt; Content and enable that feature.\n\n\nQ659\nWhat should I do if I cannot access materials in the help center? If you encounter a restricted access warning or a broken link, please contact customer support and provide the link to the article and the problematic link itself. They will help you find an equivalent resource and report the issue to the team to fix it.\n\n\nQ660\nHow can I preview the Help Center if it is not published yet? At the moment, it’s not possible to view the Help Center without publishing it.\n\n\nQ661\nWhy isn’t the Help feature displayed on the backend of our tool? The Help Center might not be turned on. To enable it, go to Articles &gt; Help Center Settings &gt; Website Publishing &gt; Turn on Help Center. You can also refer to this article for more details about setting up your help center.\n\n\nQ662\nWhy isn’t the Help Center displayed on the backend of our tool and why aren’t the translated contents displayed in the articles feed? To display the Help Center on the backend of your tool, make sure it is activated in your settings. If it’s not activated, you can enable it by going to Articles &gt; Help Center Settings &gt; Website Publishing &gt; Turn on Help Center. For translated contents not being displayed in the articles feed, ensure you have added titles to your collections in the translated language. The articles cannot be linked with a collection if there is no collection title in the translated language.\n\n\nQ663\nHow can I compare the performance of my help centers in different languages? Currently, there is no built-in feature to report on the performance difference between articles published in multiple languages from the Workspace User Interface. However, you can access this data and run your own analysis using our API or a third-party application like Zapier.\n\n\nQ664\nCan you help with DNS registration for adding a translation widget to our Help Center? It is not possible to inject any HTML or script into your Help Center at the moment. If your Help Center is multilingual, we have our own built-in toggle for language selection.\n\n\nQ665\nHow can I edit text or correct misspelled words in the Help Center? You can modify the text or correct misspelled words in the Help Center by going to the Help Center settings -&gt; Collections. Just edit the Collection description to make the necessary changes.\n\n\nQ666\nWhy don’t the descriptions of sub-collections appear in the published Help Center? The description for sub-collections won’t appear in the help center itself to prevent them appearing convoluted. This description will be used in different parts of Intercom, such as opening a sub-collection in the messenger.\n\n\nQ667\nHow can I optimize the search results for articles in the Help Center based on keywords? Intercom parses through Article titles, headings, and content for the terms searched. More weight is placed on the Articles with titles and headings matching the search terms. To make an article appear higher in search results, include the term in a title or a section heading within the Article. Additional criteria used to determine search results are the frequency of the keyword and the order of multiple words in the query.\n\n\nQ668\nHow can I track keyword search by user in my Intercom helpdesk? You can see the ‘search results’ for Articles in Reports &gt; Customer Support &gt; Articles under ‘search results’ or ‘searches with no results’ - it shows the keywords searched and so on. However, there is currently no way to export this data.\n\n\nQ669\nIs the \"old\" search system still accessible, and how can I get exact search results that include all of my specified keywords? All users have migrated to the new inbox, and the old search system is no longer accessible. Currently, the search function may not be very accurate for specific keywords. However, you can try searching for whole sentences instead of individual keywords to get more accurate results.\n\n\nQ670\nWhy can’t I find customer conversations when searching with capital letters? The inbox search for email addresses is currently case sensitive. If you’d like to request a change, you can provide feedback to the product team.\n\n\nQ671\nHow can I display customer details like name, email id, and company name in the conversation window if they are not visible? If you can’t see the customer details section in the conversation window, it might be turned off. You can turn on the details side-bar by selecting to show a right menu. Check if this option is turned on and if you are still having trouble seeing the customer details.\n\n\nQ672\nWhere can I find the conversation reference number that a customer is asking for? You can find the conversation reference number in the \"attributes\" app on the right-hand sidebar. Additionally, customers can download their conversation for future reference by pressing the export button in the Messenger.\n\n\nQ673\nHow can I track user interactions with the Messenger and manage custom attributes based on those interactions? You can’t track when a user clicks the back button in the Messenger, but there is a callback function for when the Messenger is hidden. , there are no methods to track starting a new conversation from the Messenger or articles at this time.\n\n\nQ674\nIs the GA4 integration able to send a user_id with each messenger event? The GA4 integration will not send any PII to Google Analytics. We also do not send any person-specific identifiers (such as visitor ID or user ID).\n\n\nQ675\nHow does incognito mode affect user identification, and how are users and leads classified and authenticated in Intercom? When accessing a site via incognito mode, the site cannot track your cookies across web sessions, so there’s no way for the Messenger to correctly identify users if they’re using incognito mode. Users might be classified as \"Leads\" if they are on your site and starting a conversation while being logged out. Customers need to log into your page for the Messenger to recognize and track them as users. Otherwise, they are recognized as visitors or leads. To authenticate and access user materials from the chat, users must have the User Messenger installed and have it track user log-ins. A logged-out customer should only be presented with the Lead/Visitor Messenger. If the User Messenger is showing\n\n\nQ676\nHow can I manage teammate visibility in the Intercom Messenger? To hide the teammates who are available to chat, you can remove your team’s avatars from the Home space in your Messenger settings under Web &gt; Styling &gt; Style Messenger Home &gt; Avatars. However, when you click through to send a message, they would continue to show.\n\n\nQ677\nHow are avatars displayed in the chat environment and how can I control which teammates appear in the Messenger? Teammate profile images will appear there when a user clicks \"Send us a message\". The teammates shown are those who were the first to reply to a new user conversation in the last week, up to a maximum of 3. To get a teammate to show up in the Messenger, send a test message as an end user and have that teammate be the first to reply to the message.\n\n\nQ678\nHow to change greetings suggestion? Currently, the suggested greeting cannot be turned off or on, and it is not possible to edit the greeting. If a teammate doesn’t find the greeting useful, they can simply ignore the greetings and continue typing as normal. The greeting algorithm attempts to find the most common patterns unique to each teammate based on their initial responses in conversations.\n\n\nQ679\nCan team members add personalized signatures for responding to email messages? At the moment, it’s only possible to create a business signature, not an individual teammate signature. A workaround is to have your teammates create their own personal macro with their name and sign off, which they can use at the end of an email.\n\n\nQ680\nHow can I customize the email signature for my business and apply it to all support emails? You can customize the email signature for your business and apply it to all support emails written by your team, including replies, by going to Settings &gt; Email &gt; Signature. However, email signatures per brand are not supported yet, so the same signature will apply across the whole workspace. If you need different signatures for different brands, you’ll want to use different workspaces, as signatures are workspace-specific.\n\n\nQ681\nHow can I fix the email header not showing properly in dark mode and alter the CSS code of the email template? To fix the email header not showing properly in dark mode, you can try using a more neutral color for the logo background, so it’s not too obscured in dark mode or light mode. Alternatively, you can alter the CSS code of the email template to ensure the email shows with a white background and black text even in dark mode. To alter the CSS code, go to the section of the HTML template with &lt;style&gt; tags. For example, if you want to edit the CSS for the logo specifically, find the relevant section in your template HTML and change the background-color value.\n\n\nQ682\nWhat should I do if I experience content loss when changing email templates? If your email templates are old, it’s possible that you haven’t migrated to the new WYSIWYG email template builder, and content loss is expected when updating old templates. Try creating a new template and see if you receive any messages about migrating to the new email template editor. To avoid content loss when switching templates in the future, choose the \"Keep content\" option, which will keep the content section of the current template and only load the header and footer sections of the new template.\n\n\nQ683\nWhat should I do if the thread content is spilling outside of the viewable area in my inbox window? First, try a hard refresh of your browser. If that doesn’t resolve the issue, open an incognito browser and see if the issue persists. If it still doesn’t work, check for any errors in your browser’s Console by right-clicking the page, choosing Inspect, and clicking into the Console tab. Send a screenshot of your whole page, including the Console area, to customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ684\nHow can I have the Intercom Messenger full screen on the web? Currently, there isn’t a great way to make the messenger full screen. It’s not recommended to force styling changes to the messenger as it can result in unexpected behavior or even the messenger breaking as updates are pushed.\n\n\nQ685\nHow can I add a left side spacing of 4px to the Messenger launcher? Using the default Messenger launcher, adding a left side spacing of 4px is not possible as the side spacing value must be greater than or equal to 20px. However, you can create your own custom launcher and have it display wherever you want on the page, with no restrictions.\n\n\nQ688\nHow do I change the colour of a button on an Outbound Post? To change the colour of a button on an Outbound Post, you need to modify the \"Action Colour\" in your Messenger Settings.\n\n\nQ689\nWhy doesn’t the ‘forward message’ button appear and is there any other option to forward a message if it started as a chat? The ‘forward message’ button only appears for email messages. If the conversation started as a chat, the option will not be available. It’s not possible to forward any emails started from a chat message, you would need to manually create a new email.\n\n\nQ690\nCan you switch conversation from WhatsApp to email? It’s currently not possible to switch a conversation from WhatsApp to email.\n\n\nQ691\nHow can I move a conversation from one user to another user when they have two different email addresses? You can add the new email address to the conversation in the composer, then remove the old email address so that the conversation details switch over to the original user.\n\n\nQ692\nWhat should I do if one of my team members is not receiving conversations even though they are online, have the right role, and are in the right inboxes? Check if the teammate’s assignment limit has been reached. If not, monitor the issue and provide an example conversation that was not assigned to the teammate for further investigation.\n\n\nQ693\nWhy are messages from a person within our organization not appearing in our inbox and how can it be resolved? There could be various reasons for this issue, such as the email address being on the bounce list or delivery issues on our end. To investigate, customer support may need the email addresses of the person in your organization and the email address they are trying to CC. To resolve the issue, contact customer support so they can check the email logs to identify any issues with delivery. If an email address is on the bounce list, they can remove it manually.\n\n\nQ694\nHow can I export a list of contacts if the email never arrives? Check if your email address is on the bounce list. If it is, contact customer support to clear the record from the internal bounce list. After that, any subsequent attempts to deliver to this address should be successful, provided the address is accurate and can receive email.\n\n\nQ695\nHow can I get a list of contacts that have unsubscribed or opted-out in the past 4 months? You can pull up a list of the users under the Contacts area and export them to a CSV. Use the filter \"Unsubscribed from Emails is true\" for global unsubscribes or \"Subscription type opt-outs is [List]\" for specific subscription lists.\n\n\nQ696\nHow can I manage my subscription, track People Reached usage, and discontinue my contract? To track your People Reached usage, you can export a CSV detailing the individual users and associated outbound messages from Billing &gt; Invoices. This page is accessible to teammates with Billing permissions. To remove the outbound option from your subscription plan, you can do so at your renewal. For specific pricing information, discuss with a sales representative. If you want to discontinue your contract, it is due to end on a specific date. If you’d consider staying, please let the support team know.\n\n\nQ697\nHow can I cancel my subscription? You can cancel your subscription by going to Billing &gt; Billing Settings and clicking on \"Cancel subscription\" at the bottom. Once you cancel, you’ll have access to your subscription until the next scheduled payment date.\n\n\nQ698\nHow can I cancel my subscription?

After cancelling your subscription, contact the support team to request a refund for unauthorized charges. They will review your case and, if approved, process the refund. Refunds typically process within a few days but may take up to 10 business days depending on your bank’s processing times.\n\n\nQ703\nCan I pause my subscription? At the moment, we do not offer a way to pause your subscription. You can, however, request to cancel your subscription now, and then if you decide you’d like to resume working with our service, you can resubscribe! Once you request to cancel your subscription, you will not be charged for another billing cycle on the next payment date, and you will still have access to all of your paid products for the remainder of the current payment cycle. When you cancel your subscription, all of your historic data will be preserved and waiting for you in case you change your mind and resume your subscription. To cancel your subscription, go to Billing &gt; Subscription and select \"Cancel Subscription\".\n\n\nQ704\nHow do I erase the data in my account and close it? To completely cancel everything and erase the data, you should delete your workspace. This will cancel any active subscriptions you have as well. To delete a workspace, go to your Settings &gt; General settings and at the bottom of the page, under Extreme Measures, you should see a ‘Delete this Workspace’ button. Keep in mind that this action is irreversible and will delete all your data. It’s recommended to export any invoices you need to keep on record ahead of time, since you’ll no longer be able to log into the workspace and see your billing information.\n\n\nQ705\nHow can I completely delete companies and contacts from my test account? If you untick the \"Enable a test workspace\" option and save, it will delete the test workspace. When you enable the test workspace again, it will create a new one with a new app ID.

To update the name of your workspace, go to Settings &gt; General Settings and edit the name of the workspace. Make sure to click the save button at the bottom of the page to apply the changes.\n\n\nQ708\nHow do I change my app name? You can change the name of your workspace in your General settings.\n\n\nQ709\nHow can I change the name of some custom attributes? Custom attribute names are used as identifiers for both company/people data and cannot be edited. The best way to go in this case would be to create a new attribute with a different character to differentiate it from the one you created by mistake. Attributes cannot be renamed or completely deleted.\n\n\nQ710\nHow can I delete custom data attributes and records from the database? Custom data attributes cannot be fully deleted. Instead, you can archive them. You won’t be able to use the same name as an archived attribute when creating a new data attribute.\n\n\nQ711\nHow can I use Custom Data Attributes as dynamic fields in the email HTML? You can add dynamic attributes to an HTML email using the following format: {{custom_data.your_attribute_name}}. add a fallback value, use the syntax: {{custom_data.your_attribute_name|fallback:Your fallback value}}. Custom Attributes to an HTML email can be tricky, so make sure to always test your emails before setting them live. You can test them by using the Preview feature in the top right corner.\n\n\nQ712\nHow can I include HTML in transactional emails and send multiple emails for the same event with different metadata? You can send HTML as part of event metadata, but elements inside the event metadata will get rendered as plain text in the email. Only elements specified in the HTML editor get displayed as HTML. Transactional (event-based) emails will get sent whenever an event happens and are not subject to the 1 minute/hour limit specified in Frequency and scheduling. This means you can send multiple emails for the same event with different metadata.\n\n\nQ713\nWhy can’t I see the correct metadata in an email even though it’s visible in the customer data in Intercom? When adding new metadata to an event in Intercom, it can take a while for the data to propagate and populate in the UI when you just added it (sometimes up to 24 hours). also need to make sure you have set up the audience targeting for the email to send based on the event triggering, as otherwise event metadata will not be available to add to the content of rules of the message.\n\n\nQ714\nHow can I set up referral and conversion tracking in Intercom using UTM parameters? To track conversions from outbound emails, use UTM parameters. Add UTM tracking to the links in your email, and then filter users based on UTM parameters that correspond with those UTM elements.\n\n\nQ715\nHow can I direct customers to a specific page URL and automatically complete the step in Intercom Checklists? You can select the ‘Go to page URL’ action under Step settings. This allows you to input the page URL that you wish to direct your customers to in your product, and it will automatically complete the step.\n\n\nQ716\nHow do I tag a ticket to productboard? To tag a ticket to productboard, you need to use a feature provided by one of our partners. For support, go to the Intercom App Store and click on the link to the partner’s website below their app listing. Many of these listings will also link to support documentation and their support team.\n\n\nQ717\nWhat are the limitations and management options for ticket types in Intercom? Each ticket type can have a maximum of 50 attributes, and you cannot increase this limit. You can only archive a ticket type, not delete it. If you experience issues when creating ticket types, try a hard refresh of your browser, open an incognito browser, or check for errors in your browser’s Console and contact customer support with the details.\n\n\nQ718\nWhat are the limits for ticket types and attributes in Intercom? There is currently no limit on the number of ticket types you can create for your workspace, but it is possible that a limit may be imposed in the future if necessary. However, there is a limit on the number of attributes for each ticket type, which is set at a maximum of 50 attributes.\n\n\nQ719\nWhy is there a 50 piece limit on ticket attributes and can it be expanded? The 50 attribute limit applies to just 1 ticket type, so you can have up to 50 attributes for each ticket type you create. The product team reviews all feature requests and works on new features, so keep an eye on the Product Changes page for updates. However, you cannot increase the 50 piece limit on ticket attributes for a single ticket type.\n\n\nQ720\nHow can I customize ticket types with date and time attributes, make them mandatory, and preview them in Intercom? At the moment, there isn’t a way to have separate attribute types for date and time. However, the time is optional for the Date & Time Ticket attribute. When using the Date & Time attribute, the time is automatically filled in when a date is entered. If the time is set to 0, it is automatically set to 12:00.\n\n\nQ721\nHow can I manage group settings and duplicate tooltips in Intercom? To edit group settings for tooltips, go to your Tooltip, click on Edit, and pick one of the Tooltips in the group. Then, when the editor opens, go to \"Style and layout\" and scroll down to the \"Group\" section in the \"Style\" tab.\n\n\nQ722\nHow can I add images or screenshots to numbered lists in outbound messages on Intercom? Unfortunately, Intercom doesn’t currently support images being inserted into numbered/bulleted lists, only text can be inserted into lists.\n\n\nQ723\nHow can I change my profile picture on Intercom? You can change your Avatar by going to Your Account &gt; Your Details.\n\n\nQ724\nHow can I fix the issue of not being able to upload images using the Android SDK? Update to the latest SDK version (e.g., 15.1.0) to resolve the issue. If you’re still experiencing problems, contact Intercom support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ725\nI need help with the Jira Cloud app integration The Jira Cloud integration is built and maintained by a third party, so Intercom cannot offer technical support for it. You can reach out to ToolsPlus, the company that built the Jira Cloud integration for Atlassian, through their Messenger or refer to their documentation for setting up the integration.\n\n\nQ726\nCan we choose who the reporter of the Jira is when using the Jira for Tickets app? You can’t designate the reporter for each Jira ticket that gets created. The reporter will be the designated app user, which is the Jira user that was logged in to Jira when the Intercom app was installed and the connection to Jira was authorized. It is recommended to set up a dedicated Jira user for the Intercom app.\n\n\nQ727\nHow can I retrieve all tickets using the Intercom API? Currently, our REST API doesn’t have an endpoint to retrieve all Tickets. You can only retrieve specific tickets based on the Ticket ID.\n\n\nQ728\nCan we share our device token authorizations with Intercom and retrieve them if we move away? Intercom doesn’t currently have a way of retrieving/exporting a comprehensive list of device tokens associated with each contact. However, Intercom can view the device token authorizations that you send over for each user on the back-end and can retrieve existing tokens for specific users if needed (e.g., troubleshooting).\n\n\nQ729\nCan we export APNs push tokens out of Intercom? We currently do not support importing or exporting push tokens from/to Intercom.\n\n\nQ730\nHow can I create a new OAuth token and an access token? To re-generate/create a new Access Token or oAuth Token follow the instructions outlined in this guide.\n\n\nQ731\nHow can I reconnect my Facebook/Instagram account if the access token is no longer valid? Reinstall the Instagram app and reconnect your page in the Intercom App Store with an Admin who has full permissions in Intercom and Instagram. Make sure you follow along with the relevant articles when you set that up in order to make sure you don’t miss a step.\n\n\nQ732\nWhat are the known limitations of Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter integrations? Instagram has several limitations, including inbound-only conversations, no support for Resolution Bot and Custom Bots, limited task bot functionality, text and emoji messages only, lead handling restrictions, a 7-day customer care window, and a 1000 character limit. Facebook and Twitter have limitations such as new conversation creation after 5 days of inactivity, shared task bot settings, no support for Custom Bots and Resolution Bot in Facebook conversations, and only text replies supported for Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\nQ733\nWhat are the limitations of AI bots when using external resources? AI bots have certain limitations when using external resources. For example, Google links are not supported for the AI bot’s external resources.\n\n\nQ734\nHow can I prevent drop-offs in the bot? To prevent drop-offs, consider reworking your bot and funneling customers into choosing one of the available sets of questions.\n\n\nQ735\nHow do I fix a chatbot that doesn’t respond when users select a specific language? Make sure you have connected the language options to the appropriate paths in your chatbot configuration. If the issue persists, contact customer support with the URL of the conversation where the issue occurred.\n\n\nQ736\nHow can I override the language used by a bot on a messaging platform? While you cannot disable the language detection functionality for conversations, you can control the language used by a bot on a messaging platform by using the \"Browser language\" or \"Language override\" predicate. The Language Override attribute allows you to force a specific language for a user, regardless of their Browser Language. To do this, manually update the attribute with the desired language. If the attribute has a value, it will determine the language used by the Messenger and bots for your users, taking priority over the Browser Language.\n\n\nQ737\nHow do I disable client sounds when users receive messages from our team using the JavaScript client SDK/API? You cannot disable client sounds directly through the JavaScript API. However, you can disable them in the UI by going to Messenger Settings -&gt; General settings -&gt; General. Please note that this is a global setting and cannot be modified on a user-by-user basis.\n\n\nQ738\nHow can I disable reactions in the help center or stop a chat initiating when a user reacts negatively to a help center article? It isn’t possible to disable reactions at the moment. However, you can update the functionality of starting a conversation from a negative article reaction from your Messenger settings. Go to Messenger &gt; Conversations &gt; Control inbound volume, then toggle off the ability to start a conversation from a reaction.\n\n\nQ739\nIs it possible to restore a deleted helpdesk article? Yes, within 7 days we have an option to restore an article for you, then it will be deleted permanently.\n\n\nQ740\nHow can I delete multiple articles in the Help Center? Currently, it is not possible to bulk delete articles. You will need to manually delete them one by one.\n\n\nQ741\nIs it better to have a troubleshooting or FAQ section in each article, or have separate troubleshooting articles for optimizing the help center? Both approaches can be useful. Include FAQ items related to a specific topic in the article on that specific topic, and have a general FAQ article for common questions that don’t fall under a specific topic or are too small to require an article of their own.\n\n\nQ742\nHow can I manage FAQs and target audiences using attributes, and do I need a custom domain to separate/manage FAQs on different apps? To manage FAQs and target audiences using attributes, you can separate your Articles using audience targeting. Set certain filters for the articles to be visible only to certain users/leads.\n\n\nQ743\nHow can I make articles visible only to internal users or Intercom teammates? To share internal docs with your team, set the audience filter for each article. You can set the audience filter to be users with a specific email domain or company name. Only your teammates would see these articles, and all other customers would not be able to search for or access them.\n\n\nQ744\nHow can I confirm permissions on teammates, specifically which teammate has access to creating Articles? To confirm permissions on teammates, go to the \"Teammates\" area in your Intercom settings and check your teammates’ profiles there. Unfortunately, there isn’t a permissions report available for this purpose.\n\n\nQ745\nHow can I check when a former employee had their Intercom access revoked and who revoked the access? You can check this by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Teammate Activity Logs. You have the option to review the actions taken by your team and can filter the results by date, teammate, or specific activity.\n\n\nQ746\nWhy are Intercom badges for news not appearing when we test release that to a user? The red badge will only show if a customer has visited your Newsfeed before. This means they’ll have seen any previous News Items you’ve shared and will be alerted by the badge when there is something new for them to see. If it’s the customer’s first time visiting your Newsfeed, then it is expected that no badge will appear.\n\n\nQ747\nWhat does \"publish to news center\" do? Does the audience rules still apply? When you publish to the News Center, it becomes public-facing news. The News Center currently does not follow your Newsfeed’s audience targeting rules.\n\n\nQ748\nIs Newsfeed available to be shown as a tab on the Mobile SDK? At present, the News tab is not available in our mobile SDKs.\n\n\nQ749\nHow can I access the News label management after the UI update? The News Labels are now located behind the outbound settings section. A teammate would need to enable this permission on your account to access it. They can do this from the Teammate Settings.\n\n\nQ750\nHow can I get updates on feature requests and bug reports submitted by my team? For bugs, when there is an update or a fix, the teammate who logged the bug for you will be notified within the chat and will send you an update. For feature requests, the process is complex and there is no public roadmap or ETA. However, new features and product updates are announced on the Product Changes page.\n\n\nQ751\nWhat should I do if a team member or user did not receive an email notification about a ticket update? Contact customer support and provide the details of the team member or user and the ticket. They will investigate the issue and help you resolve it.\n\n\nQ752\nWhy are some tickets not being taken into account by the inbox assignment rules? The issue might be related to the conditions in the rule not being met. For example, if the rule requires certain user attributes like browser language, country, or detected language, and these attributes are not available for a user, the rule will not trigger as expected.\n\n\nQ753\nHow do I create an inbox rule if I don’t see the Inbox Rules section in Inbox Settings? You might need to upgrade your account to access this feature. Some features are not available in the free trial version.\n\n\nQ754\nHow do I create an inbox rule, and is it available in the free trial and Support Pro plan? Inbox Rules are now Rule-Based Workflows, and part of the Workflows experience. You can find them in the Workflows section of your account. Check the Help Center for a helpful article about setting up rules-based Workflows. The Inbox Rules feature is only available with an upgrade, and it is not included in the free trial. They have been revamped and are available in the new-and-improved Workflows experience, which is part of the Support Pro plan.\n\n\nQ755\nHow can I set up an inbox rule to automatically tag incoming emails from a specific address? To automatically tag incoming emails from a specific address, you can create an inbox rule. Follow the instructions in the provided article to set up the rule.\n\n\nQ756\nHow can I run a report of our inbox filtered by a selected tag? To run a report of your inbox filtered by a selected tag, go to your Conversations Report. You can filter the results displayed by User tag, and view the report populated with conversations that match your filters. Apply the tag filter using the options near the top of the page. Additionally, you can choose to export the conversations for further analysis.\n\n\nQ757\nWhy are conversation tags not showing up in reporting and how can I differentiate between user tags and conversation tags? Conversation Tag reports are updated with a time-delay between 24 - 36 hours. This means when you apply a tag, it could take up to 36 hours for this to be processed in the Conversation Tag report. The product team is aware of this delay and is working on a solution. The issue might also be due to the tag being a user tag, not a conversation tag. The conversation tag report only shows conversation tags, not user tags. You can filter by user tag in custom reports or export a list of all your users and view which tags are applied.\n\n\nQ758\nWhat can I do if a conversation tag is not shown in the reporting, even though it is actively applied? Conversation Tag reports are updated with a time-delay between 24 - 36 hours. This means when you apply a tag (user, company, conversation, etc.), it could take up to 36 hours for this to be processed in the Conversation Tag report, which may explain why the data appears incorrect. The delay is due to system design, as applying a tag often means a significant amount of updates in the backend, as tags impact a wide variety of features in the platform.\n\n\nQ759\nIn which situations could a conversation change the value of the field updated_at in the API model conversations? The updated_at value should get updated whenever there’s an update to a conversation. This could include a new reply from a teammate or user, the conversation getting assigned to a new team or inbox, a conversation getting tagged, etc.\n\n\nQ760\nWhat’s the difference between conversation part body and message body? In the REST API, a message refers to an in-app or email message created by an admin. If a contact replies to a message sent to them, this would create a conversation in the Intercom Inbox. You can also create new conversations in the Intercom Inbox on behalf of a contact.\n\n\nQ761\nCan I create a rule to automatically tag a replied chat from our end whenever something is mentioned by us? And does \"Message Content\" include content from both the customer and us? Currently, events are mostly set based on inbound communication from the customer. The \"Message Content\" rule only triggers for the customer and not the teammate.\n\n\nQ762\nHow can I set up a trigger to send an email after a conversation is closed? There isn’t a built-in way to do this, but you can create a custom event to track the conversation closing, which would then allow the event to be used in your message targeting. You can set up a webhook using the conversation.admin.closed endpoint. Alternatively, you can advise your agents to manually tag each user with a specific tag whenever they close a conversation and then set up a dynamic email using that tag as a rule.\n\n\nQ763\nIs there a way to email chat transcripts once the user closes the chat? There’s no direct way to automatically send chat transcripts to users via email at the end of a chat. However, you can advise users to download the conversation summary themselves or download it and send it to them manually.\n\n\nQ764\nCan we automatically add an AI summary when closing a case? Currently, it is not possible to summarize the conversation via AI immediately. The teammate would need to action this manually.\n\n\nQ765\nCan the note summary feature be auto-enabled when a case is closed for the first time? Currently, you would need to select the ‘AI feature’ and hit ‘Summarize conversation’ for the AI to kick in. There is no setting for AI Assist to summarize the conversation immediately when a conversation is closed.\n\n\nQ766\nHow do I access the AI menu and options when composing a reply, and what should I do if they’re not showing up? To access the AI menu and options when composing a reply, highlight the text in the composer. If the AI options are not showing up, it could be due to a setting that needs to be activated or an issue with your account. Contact customer support for further assistance.\n\n\nQ767\nHow can I give feedback on a specific feature? You can provide your feedback to customer support, and they will forward it to the product team for consideration.\n\n\nQ768\nHow much does it cost to add a newsletter feature to our help center? The cost of adding a newsletter feature depends on your current pricing plan. You may need to switch to a newer pricing model to unlock the feature. Contact customer support for specific pricing information.\n\n\nQ769\nWhat is the cost of upgrading to 5000 surveys and the cost of outbound emails, and how much would it cost to add only 5000 surveys without outbound emails? The cost for upgrading to 5000 surveys and outbound emails, as well as adding only 5000 surveys without outbound emails, depends on the specific plan and features you choose. Please contact our sales team for a personalized quote.\n\n\nQ770\nHow can I understand my current pricing? If you’re on a legacy plan, our team provides limited support for questions around these plans, but we have resources that breaks down everything you need to know about how this pricing works. If you’d be interested in moving to one of our current plans, please let us know! For users on current plans, you can find detailed information about pricing on our website or by contacting our support team.\n\n\nQ771\nWhat features are included in the Starter plan? The Starter plan is designed for small businesses and includes a limited set of features from all of our Intercom solutions, as well as 2 seats. Features include messaging, basic Help Center tools, audience targeting, integrations with popular tools, basic reporting tools, and reaching up to 1,000 people. Additional seats may be added at an extra cost. For a full list of features, check out our pricing page.\n\n\nQ772\nCan I create a form in the chat, schedule video calls using Calendly, and access the answers via the Intercom API? Is this covered in the Starter Plan? Yes, it is possible to create a form in the chat, and it is covered in the Starter Plan. You can also use a form and Calendly to schedule video calls and access the answers via the Intercom API. The Starter Plan offers a 14-day free trial for you to test these features.\n\n\nQ773\nDo you have an Early Stage program for a smaller team with a smaller price? Yes, we have an Early Stage program which offers a discount to eligible startups. It includes Conversational Support Pro, Conversational Customer Engagement Pro (1000 People Reached), and Product Tours (Guided People) for $65/mo for 1 year, with access to 10 support seats and 5 engage seats. The eligibility criteria are: 2 years or less since founding, $1M or less in funding, 1000 people reached per month, 5 employees or less, and being a new customer.\n\n\nQ774\nHow can I reactivate the Early Stage Program? To reactivate the Early Stage Program, you’ll need to reapply for the program. You can do this by visiting the Early Stage Program application page and submitting your application.\n\n\nQ775\nWhat should I do if the link to my demo environment has expired? If the demo period has passed, you can re-ingest your content by visiting the demo page and following the instructions provided.\n\n\nQ776\nIs it possible to configure several languages on the \"Get a demo\" module? It is not currently possible to localize the Get A Demo App. The title and the content of the app are not automatically translated by Intercom.\n\n\nQ777\nHow can I show only specific language articles to customers based on their language? Unfortunately, Audience rules are the only option that would allow you to divide the Articles to appear for the right group of customers.\n\n\nQ778\nShould I join the waitlist for the multilingual feature if my content is in a non-English language? Yes, you should join the waitlist as support for additional languages is planned to be added soon.\n\n\nQ779\nIs it possible to add Finnish spell check for Intercom? We do support spell-checker tools within our product, including Grammarly, Ginger (extension), and LanguageTool.\n\n\nQ780\nCan I set up a spell check for writing emails? Yes, we support spell-checker tools within our product, including Grammarly, Ginger, and LanguageTool.\n\n\nQ781\nHow do I send a message manually on demand to hand-picked users without automation? Select a Fixed audience when composing a message. Fixed audience messages will only send to people who match your audience filters now, while Dynamic audience messages will send to everyone who matches the filters now and anyone who matches the filters in the future.\n\n\nQ782\nHow can I send a manual message with push notification? You can go to a user’s profile page and click New conversation. This will start a new outbound Chat message to that user. Sending that message will send an in-app message as well as a push notification (if they are eligible to receive push).\n\n\nQ783\nHow can I set up in-app communication and message triggers based on user inactivity or inaction? You can achieve this by setting up a Series with a ‘wait’ block for the desired amount of time of inaction, and then add a condition to check if the user has or hasn’t taken the desired in-app action (e.g., received ‘onboarding’ tour). Finally, send a message as a follow-up.\n\n\nQ784\nHow can I manage pending notifications if I can’t find the pending conversation? Currently, there is no way to mark these messages as ‘read’ automatically. You need to do this manually by scrolling down and clicking into the conversation. Look for the unread message, which is indicated by a bold title and a red dot beside it.\n\n\nQ785\nHow can I customize the subject of the email notification after a message is unread by a user for 5 minutes? Unfortunately, it’s not possible to customize the subject line of the notification email.\n\n\nQ786\nHow can I put a custom image on a custom email address I just created? We have no control over the ‘email avatar’ of your custom domain addresses; you need to do this on the email provider for the custom domain addresses.\n\n\nQ787\nWhat are the dimensions and format for profile avatar images? The ideal size for the avatar should be 128x128px and less than 1MB, and can be .jpg or .png format.\n\n\nQ788\nHow to increase screenshot quality in knowledge base articles? For the best image quality, the size of the image should be at least 640 pixels wide. This will prevent the image from being stretched or blurred.\n\n\nQ789\nHow can I insert an inline image next to text within an article? Currently, the Articles editor does not support adding an inline image within an article.\n\n\nQ790\nCan articles be scheduled for publishing or unpublishing? Articles currently cannot be published at a later date.\n\n\nQ791\nHow many articles can I create? There is no limit to the number of articles you can create.\n\n\nQ792\nIs there any limit on the number of macros I can create? There is no limit on the number of Macros you can create.\n\n\nQ793\nHow many workspaces can I have and are there any additional costs? You can create as many new workspaces as you want without additional cost. However, the features from your current workspace will not carry over to the new ones. To use the new workspace, you may need to make changes to your plan.\n\n\nQ794\nHow much does it cost to add additional workspaces for testing purposes, and how can I use Macros to improve my team’s efficiency? You can create as many new workspaces as you want without additional cost, but the features from your current workspace will not carry over. To use the new workspace, you may need to make changes to your plan. For exact cost estimates, you should contact the accounts team. Macros let your team set up pre-existing support content, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks. You can watch this video to learn how to create Macros, or take the Academy course for best practices and examples.\n\n\nQ795\nHow can I use Macros to improve my team’s efficiency? Macros let your team set up pre-existing support content, and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks. You can watch this video that shows you how to create Macros, or take our quick Academy course to learn more about best practices and see some great Macro examples.\n\n\nQ796\nHow can I use Macros to improve my team’s efficiency? Macros let your team set up pre-existing support content and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks. You can watch this video to learn how to create Macros, or take our quick Academy course for best practices and examples.\n\n\nQ797\nWhat is the difference between one-off messages and ongoing messages, and how can I use Macros to improve my team’s efficiency? One-off messages are used to send messages to leads or users right now, such as product announcements, post-event messages, or for reaching out to individual customers. Most messages can be sent as ‘fixed’ - just choose the option when targeting your message in the Rules section of your message. Learn more about dynamic vs fixed messages here. Macros let your team set up pre-existing support content, and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks to free them up to focus on solving problems with your customers\n\n\nQ798\nIf I activate Fin, and the user clicks on \"Talk to a person\", if our team is out of office, will the \"our team will come back in X hours\" message be displayed? Yes, it will. Make sure to set your Fin Profile to pass to your team if it can’t answer the question and configure your Task Bot section to share your typical reply time for Users and Visitors. With these settings, the next time your team will be in office should be displayed.\n\n\nQ799\nWhich hours does Fin use if I select its schedule for \"Set days and time this profile can send\" to \"outside of office hours\"? The \"office hours\" mentioned in the Fin profile settings refer to your workspace default office hours, not any particular teams’ office hours.\n\n\nQ800\nWhat time zone are the hourly reports based on? The hours in the reports are based on your workspace’s time zone.\n\n\nQ801\nCan users create chats outside of defined office hours and how can I prevent customers from contacting us outside of office hours? Yes, customers can reach out to you outside of office hours. It is expected behavior and there is no bug in regards to this. To prevent customers from contacting you outside of office hours, you can control the inbound conversations by adjusting settings at the end of your day to avoid getting any conversations outside of your office hours and then disable it once you’re back online.\n\n\nQ802\nHow can I set up a scheduling tool like Calendly for when there’s nobody available to answer? You can add Calendly to an Outbound Message and schedule it for only during your office hours so it does not show to customers outside of that time. You should be able to set up your office hours in Calendly so it does not give times outside of your schedule. There are also Outlook and Google Calendar apps if you prefer them.\n\n\nQ803\nWhy is the Calendly integration not working when I send a link using the lightning bolt, and the button is greyed out? It might be an issue with the app itself. You should reach out to Calendly support and mention that the button is not working when sharing a Calendly link via the Inbox app.\n\n\nQ804\nWhat should I do if the Google Calendar link is taking the user to a blank page? Check if there are any errors in your browser’s Console when this issue happens. To access your Console, press Command-Option-J, or go to your browser menu, then click More Tools &gt; Developer Tools. Clear the console, replicate the issue, and take a screenshot of any errors that appear in red.\n\n\nQ805\nWhat should I do if a user is unable to access a tour guide on the platform and receives a blank screen? First, confirm if it is a Product Tour that the customer is not able to access. If so, share a link to this tour with customer support. You can grab the URL from your browser bar when viewing the tour in the platform.\n\n\nQ806\nWhy can’t a user with all the required permissions build product tours? There could be various reasons for this issue. It’s important to check if the Intercom Messenger is installed on the URL where the user is trying to build the tour. If the issue persists, provide more information, such as a screenshot of the error message, the workspace, and the URL where the user is trying to build the tour.\n\n\nQ807\nAre Intercom’s product tours ADA and WCAG 2.1 AA compliant? Intercom’s product tours are not fully ADA or WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. They have been updated to work with screen readers and keyboard navigation, but there hasn’t been specific accessibility work done on Tooltips.\n\n\nQ808\nCan I use emojis in the description box for linked tickets? Currently, emojis are not supported in the description box for linked tickets. However, you can use third-party tools like TextExpander to insert emojis in your text.\n\n\nQ809\nHow does the behavior of Linked Tickets (previously child tickets) affect the reopening of related conversations? When there is any update or activity on a Linked Ticket, the related conversation will be automatically re-opened to let the teammate know that there is an update on the linked ticket. This is designed to make sure teammates do not miss any updates on the ticket. Currently, it is not possible to change the status of a ticket without re-opening the conversation.\n\n\nQ810\nWhy can’t I access a ticket URL and how can a ticket be deleted? A ticket URL might be inaccessible because the ticket has been deleted. Tickets can be deleted if the user associated with the ticket has been deleted for a minimum of 7 days. Typically, a conversation or ticket will only be deleted under these circumstances.\n\n\nQ811\nHow can I open a ticket URL that doesn’t work? The ticket might have been deleted, which is why you’re unable to open it.\n\n\nQ812\nI don’t see anything about my order. When can I have my order? It seems you may have contacted us by accident. We are Intercom, and we provide an online platform for businesses to make communication more personal. You have likely come to our page from one of our customers using our product. I’d suggest going back to the previous page and typing your message on the previous website you were on in order to get in touch with the company/business that you’re trying to contact.\n\n\nQ813\nWhy didn’t I get my certificate? There might be a delay with your certificate sending from our side. Please check your spam/junk folder to confirm whether you received it in the next hour or two.\n\n\nQ814\nWhat should I do if my wire transfer payment hasn’t been received by the company? If the payment hasn’t been received within the expected time frame, you should escalate the issue on your end to verify that the payment was issued.\n\n\nQ815\nWhat should I do if I receive a message about my account being frozen due to an unpaid invoice? If you have received a message regarding your account being frozen due to an unpaid invoice, please ensure that the invoice has been paid. If it has been paid, contact billing support to unfreeze your account.\n\n\nQ816\nHow can I view my open invoices? You can view your open invoices under Settings &gt; Billing &gt; Invoice History when logged in to the account.\n\n\nQ817\nHow do I access and activate workflows if I don’t see them on my account? Workflows will be made available to existing customers over the coming months. The change will largely consist of improved navigation and organization of automation features. Custom Bots and Inbox Rules will be combined under Workflows, so you can start leveraging these features right away. To access Workflows, go to the Automation section of your platform. From there, you can browse, view, and manage your Workflows.\n\n\nQ818\nHow can I test a workflow without making it live on my site and collaborate with my teammates? To test a workflow without making it live on your site and collaborate with your teammates, you can use the Audience Rules on the workflows to restrict it to your teammates by using their email addresses. Alternatively, you can use the URL Rules on the workflows to restrict the workflows to a page that isn’t accessible through normal navigation on your site.\n\n\nQ819\nHow do I fix a 401 Unauthorized message when testing custom actions? Make sure you are passing an Access Token in your API call. You can either save an Access Token in the Authentication menu or pass it over in the Headers of your API call as shown in the documentation.\n\n\nQ820\nIs it possible to trigger a custom action when a user unsubscribes? At this time, it’s not possible to base a custom action trigger off of an event like a user unsubscribing. However, there is a webhook that you can configure to trigger when this event happens. You might be able to use this if you’re looking to take some action on your own API/database.\n\n\nQ821\nHow can I create a template without an unsubscribe link for transactional emails? When it comes to mass emails sent to customers, an unsubscribe link will always be automatically added. This is due to GDPR requirements, which mandate that customers have a way to unsubscribe from emails they do not want to receive. Currently, there is no way to send large scale emails without the unsubscribe link being added.\n\n\nQ822\nCan I customize the shortcuts and add or create my own? It currently isn’t possible to disable or customize the shortcuts. Our new inbox is centered around a keyboard-first approach that uses shortcuts that allow you to work with increased efficiency. We’ve made adjustments to some of our previous shortcuts and keystrokes from the old inbox because they may be prone to errors that would accidentally action a conversation when you didn’t mean to.\n\n\nQ823\nHow to create a shortcut? At the moment we don’t support creating keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\nQ824\nWhat is the ‘code’ option in the tooltip content for? The ‘code’ option allows you to insert a markdown code block when editing the Tooltip. However, it will not execute or render any HTML content.\n\n\nQ825\nIs it possible to set up a button in a ToolTip so that the link redirects in the current tab rather than opening a new one? Currently, adding a button that contains a link to a web page in a ToolTip will always open that page up in a new tab.\n\n\nQ826\nHow can I embed videos in emails? Most email clients do not properly support embedded videos. Instead, you can create a video thumbnail with a hyperlink that, when clicked, opens the video in a new tab.\n\n\nQ827\nWhy are the YouTube embedded videos not showing up in our help articles, even though they used to work earlier? Try the following troubleshooting steps: 1. Perform a hard refresh (Command + Shift + R on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows). 2. Test in an incognito browser (Command + Shift + N on Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows). 3. Test a different browser. 4. Test an alternative Wi-Fi network or from a personal hotspot on a mobile phone. 5. Disable any browser extensions.\n\n\nQ828\nWhy is the Slack channel drop down in Rules not showing any channels? Make sure your Slack channels are all public channels within your Slack workspace.\n\n\nQ829\nHow do I set up the Slack integration if I can’t find the Inbox rules setting? To set up the Slack integration, create the Inbox rule by navigating to Settings -&gt; Inbox settings -&gt; Inbox rules. Once on the rules page, click on \"New rule\" and proceed with the rule creation as described in the Slack installation guide.\n\n\nQ830\nWhy am I not receiving webhook events or events from specific models? To receive webhook events, make sure you have set up the webhook correctly and check the logs for any errors. Ensure that you have added the correct topics for the events you want to receive, including specific models like the \"Conversation\" model. If you still don’t receive events, contact customer support with an example conversation that should have triggered the webhook for further assistance and investigation.\n\n\nQ831\nHow can I make event timestamps appear in my conversation threads? To show or hide the events in a conversation, you can use the shortcut ⌘E on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+E on Windows, or select the three dots at the top of the conversation and choose \"Show conversation events.\"\n\n\nQ832\nHow can I share a PDF or other files during a conversation? You can share a PDF or other files by attaching them to the conversation or using the file upload option provided by the platform.\n\n\nQ833\nHow do I download an attachment? To download an attachment, locate the file attached to a conversation part and click the block with the paperclip icon. The file should then download to your device.\n\n\nQ834\nWhy can’t I download the file in this chat? By default, attachments are limited to certain file types. If you cannot access a file sent to you, you can allow additional file types in Settings &gt; Security &gt; Attachment settings. However, certain file types, such as executable files, are unsupported as they pose a higher risk for malware and malicious content.\n\n\nQ835\nHow can customers attach screenshots or files in the chat window? Customers can attach files by clicking the clip icon in the Messenger.\n\n\nQ836\nIs there a function within the chat that allows you to send a data table from excel, without sending a file or image? At the moment, there is no tables feature in the inbox composer. The best workaround would be through attachments or images.\n\n\nQ837\nDoes the total number of replies sent by teammates include outbound emails? Yes, the total number of replies sent includes all conversations, not just new conversations.\n\n\nQ838\nWhy is there a discrepancy between the number of users in a segment and the number of users shown in an outbound email audience? The audience preview for email messages may differ from other targeting methods because email messages automatically exclude users who don’t have an email, have unsubscribed, have marked your emails as spam, or have bounced any emails you’ve sent to them. You can find the excluded users in your Contacts by applying additional filters.\n\n\nQ839\nWhy are there so many people reached when we don’t have that many leads and users? The People Reached metric is the number of unique people reached this past month through email, in-app messages, and notifications, as well as people who’ve engaged with messages or outbound Custom Bots. It does not include people who initiate a conversation via inbound conversation/chat, interaction with Inbound Custom Bots, or bounced emails. The number could be larger than you think because it includes various features.\n\n\nQ840\nHow does the active people count work, and what happens when it refreshes or increases? Active People is the number of leads and customers who received a message from you, sent a message to you, or customers who have logged into your app or website, in the past 90 days (including archived/deleted people). When you exceed\n\n\nQ841\nHow can I see my ‘Active People’ count for billing purposes? Active people is the number of leads and customers who received a message from you, sent a message to you, or customers who have logged into your app or website, in the past 90 days. You can find this information on your billing page. You can also create a segment of your users from the Contacts Section with the following OR filters to get a general idea of what that count is: - Last seen less than 91 days ago, OR - Last contacted less than 91 days ago, OR - Last heard from less than 91 days ago. And if you use our mobile SDK, also: - Last seen on Android less than 91 days ago, OR - Last seen on iOS less than 91 days ago.\n\n\nQ842\nHow can I see online users? To see online users, organize your Users by \"Last Seen\" in order from most recent. This will list all the Users who are online at the top of the list.\n\n\nQ843\nWhat is the step-by-step process to update a user’s displayed name? To update a user’s displayed name, follow these steps: 1. Click the little pencil icon next to the user’s name. 2. Fill in the desired name. 3. Press Enter to save the user’s name.\n\n\nQ844\nHow can I add my name to a macro as an attribute in a ticket assigned to me? To add your name to a macro as an attribute, go to Settings &gt; Data &gt; Macros and hover over the text box. The option should appear.\n\n\nQ845\nHow can I manually tag conversations when a specific admin is mentioned? You can manually tag all conversations that mention a specific admin by bulk editing their mentions. Hover over one of the mentions in the admin’s list of mentions to reveal the selection box. Click it, and you’ll be able to select all mentions and apply bulk actions on them. Click the Pen icon to edit all selected conversations and then tag them.\n\n\nQ846\nHow can I use the first name tag in Intercom HTML emails? You can use the merge tag {{ first_name | fallback:\"ENTER FALLBACK HERE\" }} in your HTML email. Replace \"ENTER FALLBACK HERE\" with a fallback greeting, such as \"Hey there,\" in case the first name is not available. This allows you to personalize your emails using the recipient’s first name.\n\n\nQ847\nHow can I use the first name tag in Intercom HTML email? You can use the first name tag in Intercom HTML email by using the full code {{ first_name | fallback:\"ENTER FALLBACK HERE\" }}. Replace \"ENTER FALLBACK HERE\" with a fallback greeting message if the first name is not available. This allows you to personalize your emails with the recipient’s first name.\n\n\nQ848\nHow can we better optimize the Intercom script on our website to help with our Google Web Core Vital scores? To better optimize the Intercom script on your website for Google Web Core Vital scores, you can delay the loading of Intercom. This allows your page to load first, and then the Intercom library is loaded once the page has finished loading.\n\n\nQ849\nIs there any information about the CES score in the data provided? We don’t have a Customer Effort Scores feature in the Intercom reports. However, you can check out our survey apps in the \"Feedback & Surveys\" category, such as AskNicely, Wootric, and Satismeter, which can be integrated with Intercom.\n\n\nQ850\nWhere are the workspaces hosted, and how is PII transferred and stored? The workspaces are hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) facilities in the United States. All PII is stored in the US servers. Intercom also uses other third party sub-processors in the United States in order to provide services. You can view the full sub-processor list on the Intercom website. Data is also sent to other Intercom entities, and more detail about who the data is transferred to and why can be found within the privacy policy on the Intercom website.\n\n\nQ851\nHow can I move my workspace to have our data processed in the EU? In order to access regional data hosting, you would need to move to an annual plan and migrate to a new instance of Intercom. Regional Data hosting is available on Sales-led, annual plans. Contact a team member to help you with the setup.\n\n\nQ852\nCan we use the SMS function in unsupported countries, like The Netherlands, for sending SMS to our clients with a business name? Currently, SMS is only supported in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. To request an additional country for coverage, please complete the provided survey to help the team learn more.\n\n\nQ853\nWhat should I do if I get an error saying \"invalid contact\" when trying to send a message? The first thing to check is the formatting of the number you are attempting to send to. The phone number must be a valid phone number, containing a country code (either with an appended +XX at the front or using the 00XX format). If a phone number does not have a country code, no outbound SMS message will be received by an end-user. Additionally, we cannot match inbound SMS messages to a profile if there is no country code attached. Lastly, the phone number must be SMS compatible – in many countries, landlines and non-mobile numbers do not support SMS. It is recommended to follow E.164 formatting when importing phone numbers.\n\n\nQ854\nHow can I resolve issues with SMS delivery and ensure my texts are sent out without problems? To resolve issues with SMS delivery, make sure the users’ phone numbers are stored in the correct format, including a country code and that the phone number is SMS compatible. Follow E.164 formatting for phone numbers. The verification process for operational SMS can take around 5-6 weeks, but the actual time may vary depending on the service provider. Once your number is verified and approved, you should be able to send messages without filtering issues. Make sure to follow the guidelines and requirements provided by the service provider.\n\n\nQ855\nWhy are SMS messages showing as undelivered? SMS messages might fail to be sent if your phone number isn’t verified yet. Although you can still send SMS messages without being verified, you are subject to more filtering on messages sent if the Toll-Free Number isn’t verified. Sometimes higher risk messages are filtered (e.g. messages with links) to avoid potential issues. It can take a few weeks for the verification application to be processed.\n\n\nQ856\nCan I use the SMS feature while waiting for approval or verification? You are able to use the SMS feature even if your number has not been verified. If you’re experiencing issues with messages not being sent, please contact our team to review.\n\n\nQ857\nHow can I activate asking for email or mobile number? You can set up Task Bots to automate repetitive tasks, such as qualifying leads. Go to Operator &gt; Task Bots &gt; For Leads and click Qualify leads. Simple qualification allows you to select data like name, email address, company name, etc. Advanced qualification Task Bot can ask leads customizable multiple choice questions to understand who they are or what they are interested in, then qualify them uniquely based on their answer.\n\n\nQ858\nHow can I use branching logic in the workflow builder and collect email addresses based on user responses? To use branching logic in the workflow builder, you can only reference data that is tracked on the user, such as attributes, the URL they’re on, whether they’re a lead or a user, etc. It cannot operate based on previous replies in the bot. To collect email addresses, you won’t be able to do it directly through branching. Instead, enable the \"Require Email\" option in your Messenger Settings page, which will prompt users to provide their email address anytime they start a conversation with you.\n\n\nQ859\nHow do Branches in Workflows function when a user satisfies the condition of multiple branches? Conditional Branches in Workflows function in a way that if a user satisfies the condition of the top branch, it selects that path, even if the user may also meet the criteria for the subsequent conditional branches. The system checks the branches starting from the top and routes the user to the path based on the first one they match.\n\n\nQ860\nIs it possible to create two different paths in series section one if it’s working hours, second if it’s some other time? I’m afraid there’s no way to create 2 different paths for this scenario, as you can only select the setting to match users during or outside office hours in an entry rules block. You’d either need to create 2 series: one for customers to enter during office hours and another one for those outside of office hours. Or otherwise, you can create a single series with 2 parallel paths and 2 corresponding entry rules.\n\n\nQ861\nIs there an API endpoint to enable/disable Workload Management for a specific team or link it to meetings? There is no specific API endpoint to enable/disable Workload Management for a team or link it to meetings. However, you can set a particular admin to away mode using the endpoint during the meeting and toggle it back on afterwards. This will prevent teammates from getting assigned new conversations using Balanced assignment/round robin during the meeting.\n\n\nQ862\nCan I assign courses to team members and review their progress in Academy? It’s not possible to auto-enroll team members in courses, but you can share the course URL with them. In terms of reviewing progress, this isn’t something you can view on your side, but you can reach out to customer support for assistance.\n\n\nQ863\nHow do I see CSAT Response rate? Currently, there’s no report that shows how often the CSAT survey was sent. However, you can create your own report by setting up CSAT as a Custom Bot that’s triggered when a conversation changes state, and add additional actions like tagging conversations with \"Asked for teammate rating.\" Then, use the Tag to see how many conversations were created with the tag, and use the regular CSAT report to see how many CSAT ratings came in. This will give you an approximate idea of the percentage of ratings sent that are actually answered.\n\n\nQ864\nHow can I manually send a CSAT survey, and what should I know about Fixed audience and client requirements? To manually send a CSAT survey, you can create a shareable link for the survey and send it to your clients. This allows you to reach customers both in and outside of your product. You can also create a macro with the survey link embedded and send it in Intercom Messenger whenever you want. Fixed audience means the message will only send to people who match your audience filters at the\n\n\nQ865\nHow do Surveys and Posts interact on the same URL, and can I add a delay time to the survey? If you have a full pop-up Post and a survey, the Post will stay in the Messenger if there is also a Survey live. To add a delay time to the survey, go to \"Where to send,\" choose \"time on current page is,\" and set the desired delay time.\n\n\nQ866\nWhy doesn’t the JavaScript work on my site? Make sure the JavaScript snippet is installed correctly and check your Messenger settings to ensure it’s visible to the right people. Also, verify your identity verification settings, trusted domain settings, and if you’re using a public suffix domain or an ad-blocker.\n\n\nQ867\nWhy is the messenger not showing on my website’s checkout page? Check if the page’s underlying source URL (\"referer\") is different than the URL that shows in your browser’s URL bar. Sometimes the underlying framework stores the page on a slightly different URL which makes filtering for exact URL matches a bit tricky. Alternatively, use a \"URL contains\" filter instead, to avoid issues with exact matches.\n\n\nQ868\nHow can I install a third-party app if I can’t see the \"install\" button? If you’re trying to integrate a third-party app, you may need to initialize the process from the third-party account. If you run into any issues, reach out directly to the third-party provider as they’ve built and provide support for the app.\n\n\nQ869\nWhy am I seeing an error \"we are unable to authenticate your payment method\"? When adding a card, we require 3D secure authentication, which is obtained through a pop-up sent by your bank. If you didn’t see such a pop-up, it may be because the card does not have this option.\n\n\nQ870\nHow can I update or add a credit card to my account? To add or update a credit card, go to Settings &gt; Billing Settings. Here, you can add a new credit card or update your existing payment card information.\n\n\nQ871\nHow can I change my billing information, such as switching from annual to monthly billing or updating the billing email? To change the payment cadence from annual to monthly, a new contract would need to be signed. You can speak to an account manager about changing the billing cadence to monthly instead of annual. To update the billing email, you can do this under your Billing Settings, or our Billing Ops team can make this amendment for you.\n\n\nQ872\nHow can I manually change the attribute option when a customer switches plans? To manually change the attribute option when a customer switches plans, first, you need to add the attribute that you’d like to update to your Qualification settings. After that, you can manually update the User’s attribute in their User profile from the Contacts page.\n\n\nQ873\nWhat happens to existing user’s qualifications if I update a current qualification’s options? If you update the text on one of the qualification options, it may impact users who had that qualification option existing in their profile. It’s important to consider the potential effects of such changes before making them.\n\n\nQ874\nHow can I automate the creation of a PDF based on qualifications using Intercom? To automate the creation of a PDF based on qualifications using Intercom, you would need some developer knowledge and resources. You can access any attributes for a contact via the REST API or listen for them in real time by subscribing to a webhook, like contact.lead.updated or contact.user.updated. As for mapping this data to a PDF, that would be something to figure out on your end. Intercom provides the user/lead data, but that’s about all they can do in this situation. You could consider looking into a third-party integration like Zapier to help with this.\n\n\nQ875\nHow can I add a tag to existing leads without manually updating each one and without creating duplicate leads? When you import leads, Intercom merges the lead’s profile into the user’s profile if it determines they are the same person. Merging occurs based on session cookies, matching email addresses, or matching users imported from a CSV. Most of the time, merging happens immediately, but occasional small delays are possible. Conversations, attributes, and events are carried over from the lead to the user profile during the merge process. If the merge does not happen automatically, you can use the REST API to convert a lead to a user.\n\n\nQ876\nWhy do duplicate leads occur and how can I prevent them in the future? Duplicate leads can occur when an individual messages you via in-app Messenger without email verification, making it difficult to know with absolute certainty that two leads created with the same email address are the same person. This is why leads are not merged. To prevent duplicate leads, it’s important to understand the specific situations that result in duplicates, such as customers clearing browser session history and cookies. Identifying the cause can help you take appropriate measures to prevent duplicates.\n\n\nQ877\nWhat should I do if a user is unable to sign up or sign in, and receives an \"already signed up\" message or didn’t receive a password reset email? If a user is unable to sign up and receives an \"already signed up\" message, they might already have an account in the system. They should try using the ‘sign in’ option instead. If that doesn’t work, they can try opening the sign-in page using an incognito window. If the user still can’t sign in and didn’t receive a password reset email, they should check their email for an invitation link from the system and open it using an incognito window. If they already have an account, they would simply need to have it added to the specific workspace.\n\n\nQ878\nHow do I bypass the welcome/first run experience? There isn’t a way to remove the quick start guide, but you can use a bookmark to point directly to your Inbox or any other page, and this will help you bypass that guide whenever you log in. For example, you can use a URL like \"https://app.example.com/a/inbox/_/inbox/\" for the inbox.\n\n\nQ879\nHow can I remove the \"quick start guide\" from my homepage or bypass it? There isn’t a way to remove the quick start guide, but you can use a bookmark to point directly to your Inbox or any other page to bypass the guide when you log in. For example, use this URL for the inbox: https://app.intercom.com/a/inbox/_/inbox/\n\n\nQ880\nCan I preview and save messenger without taking it live? You can preview the home screen from Messenger settings. However, once you save your Messenger settings, it will set live automatically. There is no option to save it without setting it live.\n\n\nQ881\nDo checklists persist/remain open across multiple pages when a user navigates between pages? The Checklist won’t remain open on subsequent pages, but it will be in the user’s Tasks in the Messenger so they can open it up and see the unfinished steps at any time.\n\n\nQ882\nCan I send multiple posts simultaneously, and if so, how do they appear to users? Yes, you can send multiple posts simultaneously. If a user qualifies to receive two posts at the same time, they will receive them both as snippets, rather than full page posts.\n\n\nQ883\nCan phishing messages be sent through the API? Yes, it is possible for phishing messages to be sent through the API. Our support engineers can investigate this further for you.\n\n\nQ884\nWhat should I do if I receive a suspicious email regarding passwords? If you receive a suspicious email, especially one regarding passwords, it’s important to be cautious. Do not click on any links or provide any personal information. If you haven’t requested a password change and receive an email about it, do not click the link. Instead, contact customer support to report the issue and get further guidance on how to proceed.\n\n\nQ885\nHow can we locate spam traps in our account? Locating spam traps is tricky since by their very nature they’re kept secret. The only way to eliminate pristine traps from your list is to remove or unsubscribe anyone from Intercom who hasn’t gone through double opt-in. To avoid sending to recycled traps, you should only email users who have been active in the past 6 months, and periodically clean your list using a validation service to remove outdated/invalid emails.\n\n\nQ886\nIs there a place where some intercom bubble click statistics through time can be seen? If a user clicks on a hyperlink or button (that automatically redirects through Intercom) inside of a message, it’s counted as a click. Clicks are counted one time per message, even if they click more than one link in the message. Clicked is the % or number of messages clicked, based on the sent number, not how many were opened. For example, if you sent 100 messages with a hyperlink in your message, and 25 users clicked that link, you would have a 25% click rate. Note: Clicks on embedded videos or clicks on images are not marked as clicked.\n\n\nQ887\nIs it possible for a survey to pop-up when a user’s mouse leaves the active window (i.e., an exit intent survey)? You can trigger a Survey based on Intercom Events that you track via our ‘trackEvent’ method. If you can set up your site in a way that calls an Intercom Event when an exit intent event occurs, then you can use that Event as a trigger for your Survey. You would need to set that up as the Trigger in the Survey’s Edit menu under the ‘When to send’ section.\n\n\nQ888\nIs the behavior of the star rating in the survey a bug or is it supposed to work this way? The color that appears for the star rating is based on the button color. If it’s the same color as the background, it may cause confusion when selecting a rating. It’s recommended to change it to a contrasting color to avoid confusion.\n\n\nQ889\nHow is the relevancy score calculated for the ‘Relevant articles’ feature in the Help Center? The feature uses a background related article search algorithm. This algorithm compares the title, description, and article body and generates a score based on its relatedness to other articles.\n\n\nQ890\nWhat does the \"Stopped looking for support\" metric mean in the self-service report? The \"Stopped looking for support\" metric refers to customers who searched for articles in the Help Center or Messenger but didn’t start a conversation or view an article.\n\n\nQ891\nHow can I find self serve support numbers in the CSV report? The CSV report only covers conversations, while the seeking support section includes all activities such as searching through help center content. This is why the numbers in the CSV report might be different from the numbers in the conversational support report.\n\n\nQ892\nHow can I upgrade my plan and create custom reports with specific filters? To upgrade your plan, you can contact customer support and provide information about your company size and the plan you’re interested in. For creating custom reports with specific filters, such as conversations with a First Response Time (FRT) of greater than 1 hour, you can consult with a Solutions Engineer who can help you set up the report correctly.\n\n\nQ893\nWhat features does the Accelerate plan include? The Accelerate plan includes features such as Account Ownership, Advanced Qualification, Article reactions & feedback, Banner messages, Mobile Carousels, Outbound emails, Post-style in-app messages, Public help center, Conversation ratings, Conversations report, Custom email templates, Scheduled messages and email delivery windows, Greater visibility control in the Messenger, Messenger home screen targeting, Require an email in the Messenger, Inbound email, Inbox Views, Permissions\n\n\nQ894\nHow can I find out what package my account has? You can find out your account package by contacting customer support or checking your account settings.\n\n\nQ895\nHow can I add a new brand to my account? Depending on your team and the brands/products you’re working with, you might want to add another workspace or manage both from your existing one. To create a new workspace: 1. Click on your avatar in the lower left-hand corner 2. Hover over your current workspace’s name and a pop-out should appear. 3. At the bottom of the \"Search for a workspace\" pop-out, click \"Add a new workspace…\"\n\n\nQ896\nHow can I assign/add users in bulk to a company? There isn’t a way to bulk assign users to a company within the UI. You can use our REST API to bulk assign users to a company, though!

Include the company object in your code, and it will automatically attach them to that company when the user logs in on your site. If the company doesn’t exist, then it will create the company automatically and attach the user to that company.\n\n\nQ898\nDoes your product act as a CRM or just interact with another CRM product?

There isn’t a straightforward way to view stats on who didn’t respond, however you can view a list of users that did respond to a specific message in your Series by clicking into that message and looking at the \"Responded\" stat. You should be able to use a workaround to view those that didn’t respond by tagging all users that were sent the message, then tagging all users that responded with a different tag. From there, you can search for those users on your Contacts page using the filters \"Tag is [tag for all users]\" AND \"Tag is not [tag for those that responded]\".\n\n\nQ906\nHow can I find all messages sent to us on weekends?

The error \"Predicates are too complex for evaluation\" typically shows up when nested segments are being used. If you have a segment within a segment and so on, it will make the search query too complicated and throw an error. It’s best to look at the individual filters used in the nested segment and add them individually in your audience rules.\n\n\nQ913\nWhy do some tickets not get filtered or sorted correctly when filtering the inbox by \"waiting longest\"? \"Waiting Longest\" is factored by when the end user sent their latest message that hasn’t received a reply. If a ticket has received a reply, even if it hasn’t been \"read\" by the end user yet, this will put them at the back of the queue once you send a message.\n\n\nQ914\nWhat should I do if my mentions notifications are not clearing?

To rename a tag, ensure that there isn’t an archived tag with the same name, as it might be preventing you from creating a duplicate. If you encounter an error when trying to rename a tag, check for an archived tag with the same name. You can either rename the tag differently or delete the archived tag with the same name.\n\n\nQ917\nWhat should I do if my mouse is not scrolling?

The access token of an app is tied to any workspace that the app is installed on. If you create an app for a specific workspace without adding it to any other, it will only be persistent to that workspace. The access token can be used by any account with valid permissions to view and access it, and the actions being performed will be shown as being from the app rather than the individual user.\n\n\nQ920\nHow can I set user attributes with the loginUserWithUserAttributes function in the React Native SDK for Intercom? The loginUserWithUserAttributes method is for logging in identified users, not logging them in and passing a non-identifying attribute.

Instead, you need to use the Intercom.updateUser(userAttributes) method to update attributes for users after they’re signed in.\n\n\nQ921\nHow should I set up a CNAME with Namecheap? All domain providers set up CNAMEs differently, so you may need to look at Namecheap’s documentation or reach out to their support team to confirm exactly how you’re supposed to add that information. Namecheap may automatically append your domain name to the end of the record, so you might only need to add intercom._domainkey. as the Name instead of the full address. You could also try that without the trailing period at the end. If that doesn’t work, reach out to the Namecheap team for confirmation on how to format that information.\n\n\nQ922\nWhich API can return the \"Phone Number Country\" field? There isn’t a phone number country field in the API for contacts at the moment. However, you can create a custom attribute for phone number country and populate this value.
